Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'ml', 'cloud', 'container', 'monitoring', 'architect', 'architecture', 'api', 'rest', 'database', 'security', 'ssl', 'continuous', 'consultant', 'beratung', 'consulting', 'projektmanagement', 'project management', 'data', 'scalability', 'performance', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 92/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** âœ… ACCEPTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the offer:
  - Leadership/management of IT software delivery teams (>20 people)
  - 10+ years delivering software projects; prior software architecture/engineering experience
  - Strong emphasis on NFRs (deployability, maintainability, operability) and design principles (scalability, availability, performance, security)
  - Project management skills (planning, monitoring, risk, budgeting, QA, resource allocation)
  - Technical familiarity with containerization, messaging/brokers/events, REST/API Gateway, software dev toolchain, DB technologies, observability
  - English required; German a plus; ability to be onsite ~25% (Berlin)

- Match vs CV:
  - Experience & leadership: ~30 years in IT with many architect/lead roles and company founder â€” clearly meets the 10+ yrs delivery and architecture requirement.
  - Management of teams: multiple team-lead/architect roles and large enterprise projects; CV demonstrates people/technical leadership though explicit ">20 people" headcount is not spelled out.
  - Cloud & infra tech: strong AWS background (Solutions Architect Professional, SysOps, Developer), Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes (KCNA), EKS, CI/CD (GitLab CI, Jenkins), IaC â€” excellent fit for ICE platform responsibilities.
  - NFRs & design principles: numerous projects focused on high availability, scalability, performance and security (Oracle WLS/OSB migrations, SAP on AWS, Landing Zone designs) â€” strong match.
  - Messaging / APIs / Observability: extensive experience with Oracle Service Bus, JMS/IBM MQ, SOAP/REST; familiarity with Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/Kibana â€” aligns well with should-have techs.
  - Dev toolchain & DBs: practical CI/CD, Git, GitHub/GitLab experience; many database technologies (Oracle, RDS, others) listed â€” matches requirement.
  - Project management & processes: documented project planning, risk handling, pre-sales, QA and delivery practices across many engagements; formal PMP/PRINCE2 certification not present (beneficial but not mandatory).
  - Language & location: German native, English fluent, based in Hamburg â€” meets language and travel/site requirements.

- Gaps / Risks:
  - No explicit PMP / PRINCE2 certification (listed as beneficial).
  - No explicit statement of managing teams of >20 people (likely but not proven in CV text).
  - Availability details (100% full-time, rotation to Berlin) would need confirmation given current status as founder/consultant.

- Overall assessment:
  - Andreas Wittmann is a strong technical and leadership fit for an Infrastructure Team Lead on a cloud platform like ICE: excellent AWS/infra/IaC/container and messaging/API experience, proven architecture and delivery background, solid observability and ops understanding. Minor gaps are formal PM certification and explicit large-team headcount evidence, and practical confirmation of full-time availability and willingness for the specified onsite rotation.

- Score rationale: high alignment on must-have technical and leadership skills â†’ 92/100.
