- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 11%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'ml', 'monitoring', 'api', 'rest', 'compliance', 'training', 'data', 'performance', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **Fit Score:** 40/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- **Skills Requirement**: GMP knowledge, operational maintenance methods, CMMS systems (JDE, SAP), data analysis, root cause analysis, problem-solving, English fluency.
- **Technologies**: JDE, SAP, reliability engineering, equipment maintenance, CMMS.
- **Experience**: Pharma/biotechnology sector, reliability engineering, collaboration with teams.
- **Comparison**: Andreas Wittmann's CV shows extensive experience in IT consulting, cloud architecture, and engineering, primarily in AWS and Oracle environments. However, he lacks direct experience in the pharmaceutical sector and with GMP environments. Similarly, there is no explicit mention of CMMS systems like JDE or SAP in his CV. 
- **Soft Skills**: While Wittmann has demonstrated problem solving and collaboration skills through various projects, the specific application of these skills in a GMP environment is not evident.
- **Conclusion**: The key missing elements are specific experience with GMP, CMMS systems like JDE or SAP, and direct pharmaceutical industry experience. These are crucial for the role presented. The technical skills and industry knowledge required do not align closely with Wittmann‚Äôs background, which affects the fit score negatively.
