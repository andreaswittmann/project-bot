Please read before applying:
We are not looking for tech leads, architects or former engineering managers who haven‚Äôt shipped production code in the past years. This role is for senior developers who are still in the code 80% of their time, solving real problems, deploying real systems, and continuously pushing quality forward. We need to solve problems in a pragmatic, code-focused way. If your recent roles were mostly management, team leadership, or coordination, this is likely not the right fit.

JOB DESCRIPTION
Our client is looking for a hands-on Senior Software Developer a pragmatic, product-oriented mindset. You combine strong architectural thinking with the ability to ship high-quality code thoughtfully and predictably.

You are fluent in modern engineering practices, comfortable in heterogeneous, service-oriented and distributed environments, and focus on writing robust, maintainable code for systems that scale.

You will help evolve a business-critical platform‚Äîleading the transition from a heterogeneous semi-distributed codebase to a strategically aligned, reliable, and scalable architecture. You will balance delivery speed with long-term sustainability and champion tools and techniques that multiply engineering effectiveness.

What you'll do:
- Design, build, and run a business-critical software platform using modern frameworks and programming languages
- Spearhead the migration from a semi-distributed codebase to a unified, scalable architecture
- Analyze trade-offs, risks, dependencies, and user value to drive technical decisions
- Solve complex technical problems hands-on
- Operate close to production: build it, ship it, support it
- Champion clean code, test coverage, and performance-first thinking
- Evaluate and apply emerging developer tools where they provide real leverage (e.g., GitHub Copilot, GPT agents, etc.)

Who we're looking for:
- 8‚Äì12 years of professional experience in software development with at least 80‚Äì100% of your last 2-3 years spent coding, shipping, and deploying
- Proficiency in .Net and C#
- Proven track record of delivering production-grade systems
- Strong foundation in computer science fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, complexity)
- Applied architectural knowledge: modular monoliths, microservices, event-driven systems, actors, etc.
- Experience working in distributed systems: idempotency, consistency, backpressure, observability
- Confident working with relational databases (schema design, migrations, tuning)
- Familiarity with modern delivery stacks: Git, GitOps, CI/CD, Docker, etc.
- Strong communication and collaboration skills; self-starter attitude
- Fluent English (C1/C2); German is a strong plus

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 50/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 89/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements (from project):
  - Proficiency in .NET and C#; 8‚Äì12 years active software development with 80‚Äì100% of last 2‚Äì3 years spent coding and shipping production code.
  - Strong foundation in CS fundamentals; experience with modular monoliths/microservices, event-driven systems, distributed-systems concerns (idempotency, consistency, backpressure), relational DB design/migrations/tuning.
  - Modern delivery stacks: Git/GitOps, CI/CD, Docker, observability, testing and performance-first mindset.
  - Hands-on contributor (code ~80% of time), pragmatic/product-oriented, fluent English.

- Matches in the CV:
  - Extensive hands-on experience with cloud-native tooling: Docker, Terraform, AWS (many services), EKS/Kubernetes (KCNA), Git, GitHub/GitLab, CI/CD (Jenkins, GitLab CI), Docker, Helm, Argo CD.
  - Strong distributed-systems and integration background: long history with ESB, Oracle Service Bus, WebLogic, high-availability architectures, migrations to cloud, messaging and enterprise integration patterns.
  - Relational DB experience (Oracle, RDS, HANA/SAP context) and large-scale production deployments and migrations.
  - Experience with observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana) and infrastructure-as-code, automated tests, and operational runbooks; demonstrable production deployments and support.
  - Fluent English, many recent hands-on technical projects (Terraform scripts, LibreChat customization, Docker deployments, live-scripting repo) and active use of GitHub and Copilot.

- Gaps / mismatches:
  - No evidence of .NET or C# experience in the CV ‚Äî this is a primary requirement for the role and is not shown.
  - The client explicitly wants developers who spent ~80‚Äì100% of last 2‚Äì3 years coding in the product codebase; Andreas‚Äô recent focus is strongly on cloud/DevOps/architecture and consultancy. He has written deployment/automation code and integrations, but not shown as a C# product maintainer delivering business logic in .NET.
  - The job seeks engineers who are not primarily architects/managers; Andreas is a senior consultant/architect/CEO with many architect- and consulting-focused engagements (though he does still perform hands-on technical work).

- Overall assessment / recommendation:
  - Strong match on cloud-native, DevOps, distributed systems, CI/CD, observability, databases and shipping production infra. Excellent for roles that need AWS/Terraform/Kubernetes/DevOps plus distributed-systems expertise.
  - Significant mismatch for a strict hands-on C#/.NET product engineer role where most recent years must be spent coding in C#; candidate would need to demonstrate recent .NET work or be willing to ramp quickly into C# product development.

- Suggested next step: If the client can accept a polyglot senior developer with immediate strengths in cloud/DevOps and system-level code (and some ramp time for C#), consider interview. If the role is strictly C# hands-on, this candidate is a weak fit.
