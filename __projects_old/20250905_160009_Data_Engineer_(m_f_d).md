## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-05T16:02:21.935294

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 16/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 16%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'architect', 'architecture', 'pipeline', 'git', 'rest', 'database', 'integration', 'security', 'agile', 'continuous', 'deployment', 'consultant', 'data', 'analytics', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 60/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements:
  - Azure tool stack and Databricks proficiency
  - Design scalable data architecture and Price Data Product
  - Build/maintain reliable data pipelines, data harmonization, quality, security
  - Data warehousing, data modelling, relational DB experience
  - Agile team collaboration and knowledge sharing
  - (Optional) Energy domain experience

- Relevant matches from CV:
  - Strong cloud architecture and platform experience (many AWS professional certs, multi-account/landing zone design, EKS, Terraform, IaC)
  - Proven experience building and automating infrastructures and pipelines (GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, Terraform, Saltstack, scripting in Python/bash)
  - Extensive integration/ESB experience (Oracle Service Bus, Weblogic) ‚Äî relevant for data harmonization and system integration
  - Relational DB expertise (Oracle, migration projects) and architecture work for SAP BW/4HANA on AWS (shows data-warehouse related architecture capability)
  - Kubernetes, monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana), security and operational hardening experience
  - Senior/architect level with strong consultancy, Agile usage (Scrum/Kanban) and documentation practices

- Gaps / risks:
  - No explicit Azure platform experience documented (Azure services, ADF, Synapse, ADLS, Azure IAM)
  - No explicit Databricks / Spark / PySpark experience listed (Databricks is a core requirement)
  - Limited explicit evidence of building large-scale data warehouse products or modern lakehouse implementations (Delta Lake, Databricks patterns)
  - No energy-sector experience (optional only, but may be preferred)

- Assessment summary / recommendation:
  - Candidate scores well on architecture, integration, pipeline automation, IaC and cloud-operational maturity ‚Äî strong, transferable foundation for a Data Engineer role.
  - However, the two critical stack items (Azure + Databricks) are missing from the CV and would require ramp-up. If the client can accept a rapid cross-cloud hire (candidate learns Databricks/Azure quickly given strong cloud background) this is a good fit. If they require immediate hands-on Databricks/Azure experience from day one, this candidate is a weak match.

- Fit rationale (score 60/100): strong transferable engineering and architecture skills (+), missing direct Azure/Databricks experience (-).
