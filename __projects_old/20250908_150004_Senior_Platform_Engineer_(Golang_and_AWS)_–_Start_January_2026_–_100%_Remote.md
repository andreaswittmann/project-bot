## Beschreibung
we are looking for external support starting January 2026 in the role of a Senior Platform Engineer (m/f/d).
The position is 100% remote.
Important note: Candidates must have strong expertise in both Golang and AWS.
We are not looking for generic backend engineers or cloud engineers ‚Äî only developers who are proven in both areas. I have been working with Golang and AWS myself for more than 10 years, and I will personally conduct the technical interviews.

## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-08T15:01:35.679263

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 20/100
- **Threshold:** 15/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 20%. Found tags: ['aws', 'amazon', 'ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'monitoring', 'architect', 'architekt', 'architecture', 'architektur', 'pipeline', 'infrastructure as code', 'bash', 'shell', 'api', 'security', 'iam', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 45/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 89/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project must-haves: Golang (expert + TDD, table-driven tests, idiomatic Go, interface design), AWS (DynamoDB single-table design, EventBridge, IAM/KMS, VPC, API Gateway, Step Functions, Lambda, CloudWatch, CodePipeline/canary, CloudFront, Route53, CDK in Go), plus DNS and TLS fundamentals.  
- Strong matches from CV: extensive, recent and certified AWS expertise (Solutions Architect Pro + many AWS services listed including DynamoDB, EventBridge, Step Functions, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudWatch, CloudFront, Route53, IAM/KMS, VPC); solid IaC and DevOps experience (Terraform, CloudFormation, automated CI/CD pipelines, GitLab CI/GitHub knowledge); observability basics (Prometheus/Grafana exposure); strong security/SSL and networking ops experience; senior-level architecture and platform experience.  
- Partial/uncertain matches: DynamoDB is listed among AWS services but there is no explicit evidence of single-table design and composite-key/access-pattern experience; EventBridge and event-driven patterns are named in the services list but no explicit EventBridge aggregator-pattern projects described; CDK is not mentioned (only Terraform/CloudFormation).  
- Major gaps: no Golang experience shown (CV lists Java, Python, Shell, but not Go) ‚Äî Golang is a core, explicitly required skill; no evidence of Go-specific practices (table-driven testing, idiomatic Go, interface design) or CDK in Go; OAuth2/OpenTelemetry/X-Ray and Go-centric TDD practices are not demonstrated.  
- Assessment summary / recommendation: candidate is a strong senior AWS/platform architect with excellent cloud, IaC and operational skills and would be a high-value hire for many platform/DevOps roles. However the client explicitly requires proven, strong Golang expertise (including Go testing idioms and CDK in Go), which the CV does not demonstrate. Acceptable only if the client is willing to compromise on immediate Go expertise and accept a senior AWS engineer who can learn Go quickly; otherwise candidate is a weak fit for this Go-centric developer role.  
- Score rationale: AWS/platform fit ~85/100, Golang fit ~5/100; given the job's equal emphasis on both, weighted overall fit ~45/100.
