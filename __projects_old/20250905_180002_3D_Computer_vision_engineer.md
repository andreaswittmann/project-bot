We are looking for a Senior 2D/3D Computer Vision Engineer to build the core technology that makes our platform possible. The central challenge is to automatically generate clean, geometrically accurate, and simplified 3D roof models from raw aerial Digital Surface Models (DSM) and RGB data.

As the owner of this domain, you will:
‚Ä¢ Define the Process: Take charge of the entire ML pipeline, from R&D to production. This includes refining the annotation process and enhancing our existing Three.js-based 3D annotation tool to build a high-quality, large-scale dataset.
‚Ä¢ Build the Models: Research, develop, and train a suite of models to handle roofprint segmentation, structured prediction of planar roof wireframes from point clouds, and detection/classification of roof obstructions (chimneys, pipes, windows, etc.).
‚Ä¢ Ship to Production: Engineer a scalable and robust inference pipeline that can process new properties on demand.

Our stack is Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, Rasterio/GDAL, and JavaScript/Three.js for the annotation tool. We are looking for a pragmatic and experienced engineer who loves tackling complex 3D vision problems.

Must have experience: 2D and 3D data (especially point clouds and geospatial imagery) and have a proven track record of delivering end-to-end ML solutions.

Candidates who fit all the above apply

## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-05T18:01:34.369312

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 12/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 12%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'ml', 'cloud', 'pipeline', 'python', 'git', 'api', 'lean', 'data', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 35/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements (from project):
  - Senior 2D/3D computer vision engineering (roof segmentation, planar wireframe extraction, obstruction detection)
  - Experience with point clouds, DSMs and geospatial imagery
  - End-to-end ML delivery: R&D ‚Üí dataset/annotation ‚Üí training ‚Üí production inference pipeline
  - Tech stack: Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, Rasterio/GDAL, JavaScript/Three.js (annotation tool)
  - Pragmatic researcher/engineer able to build scalable inference and data annotation tooling

- Matches in CV (strengths):
  - Strong, long-term engineering and architecture background; proven production delivery experience
  - Broad Python experience across many projects (automation, scripting, tooling)
  - Cloud, container and infra expertise: AWS (wide set of services, Solutions Architect Pro), Docker, Terraform, EKS/Kubernetes, CI/CD ‚Äî valuable for productionizing inference pipelines
  - DevOps/ML-infra adjacent work (AWS Bedrock, SageMaker listed in training/certifications) and recent generative-AI projects showing AI/ML platform familiarity
  - Experience building tooling, automation, dataset/deployment automation (Live-Scripting, IaC, Terraform)

- Gaps vs. must-haves (risks / missing items):
  - No explicit hands-on experience with PyTorch or deep-learning model development documented
  - No evidence of work with point clouds, DSMs, geospatial raster processing, or libraries like Rasterio/GDAL
  - No explicit 2D/3D computer-vision publications, projects or sample models (roof segmentation, wireframe extraction, point-cloud structured prediction)
  - No mention of FastAPI or building Python-based inference microservices (though related infra skills exist)
  - No Three.js / JavaScript annotation-tool development experience listed

- Overall assessment and recommendation:
  - Andreas is a strong candidate for roles focused on cloud/infra/productionization of ML systems and DevOps for AI ‚Äî he can design and operate robust inference/data pipelines quickly.
  - However, this role specifically requires deep, hands‚Äëon 2D/3D CV and point-cloud modeling experience (PyTorch, geospatial data processing, annotation tooling) which are not evidenced in the CV. That makes him a partial fit: excellent for engineering/ops/architect responsibilities around an ML stack but not as an owner for core research and model-building tasks in 3D vision without upskilling or partnering with a CV specialist.

- Fit score rationale: 35/100 ‚Äî score reflects strong infra, Python and productionization capabilities (positive), but significant gaps in domain-specific 3D CV, PyTorch, point-cloud and geospatial tool experience (negative).
