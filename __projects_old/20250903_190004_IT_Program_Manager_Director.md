## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-03T19:02:50.834891

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 10/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 10%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'agile', 'scrum', 'kanban', 'projektmanagement', 'project management', 'data', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 75/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project: program strategy & leadership; partner with C-level stakeholders; plan/execute/deliver complex multi-team technical programs; manage timelines, budgets and resources; stakeholder management across PM, engineering, QA, UX, data, marketing and external partners; risk & change management; KPI/dashboarding and governance/reporting; strong Agile (Scrum/Kanban/SAFe) experience; fluent English (German a plus).
- Strong matches in the CV: ~30 years of IT experience, founding Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer (leadership); extensive track record delivering large technical migrations and multi-environment rollouts (Oracle, OSB, AWS, SAP migrations) ‚Äî demonstrates program execution capability.
- Agile & delivery practices: explicit use of Scrum, Kanban, pair programming, CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI, Jenkins), IaC (Terraform, CloudFormation) and DevOps ‚Äî aligns well with required SDLC knowledge.
- Cloud/platform expertise: deep AWS experience (Landing Zones, multi-account, many AWS services) and certifications (AWS Solutions Architect ‚Äì Professional) ‚Äî useful for technical stakeholder credibility.
- Stakeholder & governance evidence: frequent client-facing consulting, pre-sales/support, creation of offerings, monitoring/cost planning for AWS projects, patch plans and documentation ‚Äî indicates good stakeholder handling and some governance/reporting experience.
- Gaps / weaker evidence: limited explicit statements about running cross-functional product programs including UX, marketing and QA leadership; little explicit evidence of direct budget ownership or large headcount/resource allocation responsibility at program/director scale; SAFe experience not mentioned; explicit KPI/dashboarding for executive reporting is hinted (monitoring, cost calc) but not strongly documented.
- Language & engagement model: native German and fluent English; long-term freelance/consulting experience and current GmbH make remote freelance engagement likely feasible.
- Overall assessment: very strong technically and experienced in leading complex technical deliveries and stakeholder engagement, but somewhat less explicit evidence of director-level program governance across product/marketing/UX and explicit budget/resource ownership. Suitable for the role with moderate onboarding on product/marketing stakeholders and formal program governance practices.
