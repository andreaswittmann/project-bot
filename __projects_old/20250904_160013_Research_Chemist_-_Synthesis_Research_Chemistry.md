## Beschreibung
Research Chemist - Synthesis Research Chemistry contract opportunity to join our Stein based client in the Agricultural and Chemical sector. Your tasks:
- Synthesis: Safe, sustainable, effective and independent execution of synthetic routes, partnering with key support platforms (e.g. automation, analytical, purification platforms) to maximize efficiency.
- Synthesis: Independent and collaborative design of efficient synthetic routes to target molecules and sets of molecules using knowledge, experience, and available digital tools.
- HSE: Carry out detailed risk assessment of experimental procedures and raw materials in line with HSE standards.
- Documentation: Document and communicate experimental procedures and data with highest scientific accuracy and sufficient observational details to enable easy reproduction, retrieval, digital integration, and secure IP.
- Problem solving: Independent and collaborative problem solving and troubleshooting of synthetic chemistry within project.
- Knowledge: Maintain excellence in modern synthetic methods and technologies through continuous personal development.
- Continuous improvement: Contribute to continuous improvement of laboratories and ways of working, identifying, removing, and escalating blockers to increase laboratory safety and productivity.

Your experience/knowledge:
- Proficient in all aspects of synthetic organic chemistry, including reaction design, retrosynthesis, troubleshooting, purification and structural elucidation, all with high standards of HSE.
- Collaborative and self-motivated: works effectively within teams and able to deliver with autonomy.
- Comfortable working with software tools related to design of synthesis programs and analysis of synthesis data.
- Proficiency in English is required. Other languages are valued
- Minimum qualification is a master's degree or 3 - 5 years of industrial experience following full training through an apprenticeship program, both in synthetic chemistry

Your soft skills:
- Excellent comprehension skills with attention to detail
- A high degree of self-organization and time management
- Analytical and solution-orientated thinking
- Be flexible, curious and eager to learn new technologies.

## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-04T16:01:56.757466

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 12/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 12%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'ml', 'automation', 'git', 'rest', 'integration', 'agile', 'continuous', 'training', 'data', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 5/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project:
  - Proficient in synthetic organic chemistry (reaction design, retrosynthesis, troubleshooting, purification, structural elucidation)
  - Hands-on lab execution with strong HSE / risk-assessment experience
  - Laboratory documentation enabling reproducibility and IP protection
  - Familiarity with software tools for design/analysis of synthesis data and automation platforms
  - Minimum MSc in chemistry or 3‚Äì5 years relevant industrial synthetic chemistry experience
  - On-site work in Stein, CH; Swiss work-permit / EU nationality constraints

- Match against the CV (Andreas Wittmann):
  - Positive / transferable matches:
    - Strong experience in documentation, reproducible 'live-scripting' and process documentation
    - Substantial automation / DevOps background (Terraform, Docker, CI/CD, scripting, infrastructure automation)
    - Experience with tooling, version control (Git), and digital integration of workflows
    - Demonstrated continuous learning, problem-solving and process improvement mindset
    - English proficiency and EU nationality (German) ‚Äî potentially eligible for Swiss work
  - Major mismatches:
    - No education or professional experience in chemistry or synthetic organic chemistry
    - No hands-on laboratory experience, no HSE / lab risk-assessment track record
    - No evidence of skills in purification techniques, structural elucidation (NMR, MS, chromatography), or chemistry-specific software
    - Role requires on-site bench work and domain expertise that the CV does not show

- Rationale / conclusion:
  - The candidate brings strong, relevant skills in automation, documentation and tooling that are broadly transferable to workflows and digital lab integration. However, the core domain expertise required (synthetic organic chemistry, laboratory execution and HSE competence) is entirely absent. For a hands‚Äëon Research Chemist role this is a decisive gap. The small positive score reflects transferable process and tooling strengths plus likely eligibility to work in Switzerland; the overwhelming domain mismatch drives the score to near zero.

- Recommendation:
  - Not suitable for this Research Chemist (synthetic chemistry) role. Consider the candidate only for digital/automation/DevOps roles supporting laboratories (e.g., lab informatics, infrastructure for automated labs) where chemistry domain knowledge is not a hard requirement.
