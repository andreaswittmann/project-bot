  - Has project management experience.
  - Proficient in Python and has worked with databases but lacks specific data science project experience.
  - Excellent English skills noted.
- **Rationale**:
  - While Andreas has strong technical skills, he lacks direct experience in the core areas of fraud detection, risk management, and data science within banking.
  - His extensive IT and consulting background provides some transferable skills, but the direct experience as a Data Scientist in a banking context is limited.
