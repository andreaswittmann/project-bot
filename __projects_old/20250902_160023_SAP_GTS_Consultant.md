- **Customs Processes**: The role requires solid knowledge of Swiss customs processes, particularly the Passar implementation. The CV does not indicate any experience in customs processes or relevant knowledge.
- **Middleware and IDoc**: The project involves working with Seeburger middleware and IDoc handling in SAP interfaces. While Andreas has significant middleware experience, there is no specific mention of Seeburger or working with IDocs.
- **Project Management Skills**: Although Andreas has extensive project management and consulting experience in IT projects, this is not specific to SAP GTS or SAP-related projects.
- **Language Skills**: The role requires fluency in English, and German is a plus. Andreas is fluent in both, which is a positive match.
- **Technical Experience**: Significant technical prowess is noted in the CV with expertise in middleware and cloud solutions, but there is a misalignment in the specific industry and technology focus needed for the project.

- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- **SAP GTS Experience**: The project requires experience as an SAP GTS Consultant, specifically focusing on Version 11.0 and SAP GTS Edition for SAP HANA. Andreas Wittmann's CV does not mention any experience with SAP GTS, which is a major gap for this role.
- **Customs Processes**: The need for solid knowledge of Swiss customs processes, particularly Passar implementation, is not addressed in the CV. There's no indication of experience in customs processes.
- **Middleware and IDoc**: While the candidate has significant middleware experience, there's no specific mention of Seeburger middleware or IDoc handling, key components of the role.
- **Project Management Skills**: Andreas has extensive project management and consulting experience in IT, but this experience is not specific to SAP GTS or SAP-related projects, which limits his fit.
- **Language Skills**: The role requires fluency in English with German as a plus. Andreas speaks both fluently, aligning him well in this regard.
- **Technical Experience**: Although technically proficient, Andreas's expertise is in cloud solutions and middleware, whereas the project needs specific SAP GTS and customs expertise.
- **Location and Permits**: The role is open to Swiss nationals, EU citizens, or those with Swiss work permits. Andreas is based in Germany and holds German nationality, which means he could be eligible, but his location is not the preferred fit.
