## Beschreibung
5 new openings for a brand new German AIS practice management system.

We have been instructed exclusively to assist one of Germany's most established e-health technology companies as they begin an exciting new era and create a brand new product.

This completely greenfield project sees us begin the search for a Technical Lead, 2x Senior Software Engineers and 2x Product Managers, but more specifically, I'm looking for professionals with the following niche skillset:

- Experience working with German AIS systems
- Have already been involved in obtaining a KBV certification
- Familiar with KBV requirements for practice information systems
- Have knowledge of Gematik Infrastruktur

These are remote first openings based out of Germany, and we are looking for German and English speaking candidates.

This project is likely to last between 12-18 months.

If this sounds like you, reach out to hear more about these fantastic opportunities - interviews will begin next week and slots are sure to fill up!
