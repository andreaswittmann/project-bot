## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-03T11:04:41.521309

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 13/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 13%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'rest', 'sql', 'integration', 'continuous', 'consultant', 'data', 'analytics', 'performance', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 20/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the offer:
  - ABAP CDS views / AMDP / SQL as backend for Fiori / Analysis for Office / SAC: REQUIRED
  - Embedded BW in S/4HANA and S/4HANA implementation/migration experience: REQUIRED
  - Familiarity with reporting tools (SAP Analysis Office, Cognos Analytics, Fiori Design Studio): REQUIRED
  - HANA DB troubleshooting/performance knowledge: NICE-TO-HAVE
  - Fiori transient query apps, S/4 modules (FI/CO, SD, P2P): NICE-TO-HAVE
  - Remote, 40% engagement, fluent English: logistical requirement

- Match against CV (Andreas Wittmann):
  - ABAP / CDS / AMDP: No evidence in CV ‚Äî not present.
  - Embedded BW in S/4HANA & hands-on S/4 development/migration: Largely absent. CV shows an architecture project for SAP BW/4HANA on AWS (2021) ‚Äî infrastructure/architecture experience, but not Embedded BW in S/4 or ABAP/report development.
  - Reporting tools (Analysis Office, Cognos, Fiori Design Studio): Not shown. CV lists many reporting/monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) but not SAP reporting stacks.
  - HANA DB knowledge / performance tuning for HANA: Not shown. Strong DB and performance experience (Oracle, WebLogic tuning) but no HANA-specific skills.
  - Fiori app development / transient queries: Not shown.
  - Relevant strengths: deep cloud/infra (AWS), Terraform, automation (IaC), monitoring, performance tuning, migration experience for middleware/enterprise services; fluent English likely given CV.

- Assessment / recommendation:
  - Core, mandatory skills for this role (ABAP CDS/AMDP, embedded BW for S/4, SAP reporting tool experience) are missing. The candidate is a strong cloud/infra/architecture consultant but not a fit for a hands-on SAP ABAP S/4HANA Embedded Analytics developer/consultant role without substantial upskilling.
  - Could be considered only for a complementary infrastructure/architecture advisory slot (e.g., SAP on AWS infra, performance/ops) but not as the main Embedded Analytics consultant requested.

- Conclusion: Low fit for this specific ABAP S/4HANA Embedded Analytics position due to lack of ABAP/S/4HANA embedded analytics and HANA reporting tool experience.
