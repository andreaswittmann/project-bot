JOB & PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Our client is upgrading their technology stack and accelerating automation across core systems. The in parts newly assembled tech & product team plays a critical role in building scalable, efficient, and modern solutions to replace manual workflows, boost delivery speed and increase efficiency overall. In addition, the team is working on transforming the business into a true platform model.

Our client is looking for a hands-on Senior DevOps Engineer to lead a green-field migration of a software platform onto a modern, fully automated infrastructure stack. You will design the target architecture end-to-end, codify infrastructure, and establish streamlined, developer-friendly processes. You will collaborate closely with software engineers, yet operate with a high degree of autonomy.

What you'll do:
- Audit & document the current on-prem / legacy Azure estate, identifying technical debt and migration paths
- Design a future-proof, highly available Kubernetes-based platform (incl. networking, security, multi-AZ, service mesh)
- Implement IaC pipelines (Terraform/Bicep, GitOps) and automated CI/CD in Azure DevOps
- Establish observability (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki/ELK, OpenTelemetry, eBPF-based tracing) and integrate Azure Application Insights with SLO/SLA monitoring
- Define & execute blue/green & canary deployment strategies, rollback procedures, disaster-recovery plans
- Containerize existing .NET/Python services with support from development teams; orchestrate migration to Kubernetes
- Optimise build pipelines and runtime environments for cost, performance, and security (DevSecOps & compliance)
- Evaluate & introduce modern tooling and AI/LLM-powered automation to multiply operational throughput
- Mentor the infra & ITOps squad, share best practices, and champion a DevOps/SRE culture across the organisation

Who we're looking for:
- Deep fundamentals: Demonstrable expertise in Linux cgroups, namespaces, eBPF tracepoints, TCP/IP networking, CAP theorem, and distributed systems theory; ability to defend every design choice with data, trade-off analysis, and computer-science fundamentals
- 5+ years operating production systems and CI/CD pipelines in cloud environments (Azure preferred)
- Expert knowledge of Kubernetes (cluster design, operators, Helm/Kustomize, troubleshooting) and containerisation
- Solid experience with IaC (Terraform, Ansible, Bicep, Pulumi or similar) and Git-centric workflows (GitOps/ArgoCD/Flux)
- Hands-on expertise in observability stacks and incident response/on-call in 24/7 environments
- Strong understanding of relational databases, storage, networking, and Linux fundamentals
- Proven track record migrating monolithic or VM-based workloads to microservices/containers in regulated settings (fintech a plus)
- Ability to work self-directed, handle ambiguity, and communicate clearly in English (C1/C2)
- Nice to have: Experience with modern (.NET 8+) and legacy (.NET Framework) .NET applications

## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T10:15:42.778450

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 32/100
- **Threshold:** 15/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 32%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'llm', 'ml', 'cloud', 'terraform', 'kubernetes', 'container', 'helm', 'argo', 'prometheus', 'grafana', 'monitoring', 'architect', 'architecture', 'devops', 'ci/cd', 'pipeline', 'automation', 'iac', 'ansible', 'python', 'git', 'database', 'integration', 'security', 'compliance', 'continuous', 'deployment', 'linux', 'data', 'performance', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 68/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 89/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements identified: Kubernetes (cluster design/operators/Helm), Azure + Azure DevOps, IaC (Terraform/Bicep/Pulumi/Ansible), GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux), CI/CD pipelines, observability (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/ELK/OpenTelemetry, eBPF tracing), containerisation of .NET/Python services, Linux fundamentals (cgroups/namespaces/TCP-IP), migration of monolith/VMs to containers in regulated environment, DevSecOps/compliance, incident response/on-call, mentoring.

- Strong matches (clear evidence in CV):
  - Kubernetes knowledge and cloud-native basics (KCNA cert, K3s, EKS, Minikube, Helm mentioned in trainings).
  - IaC and automation: HashiCorp Terraform certification, Terraform scripts & HCP experience, SaltStack, CloudFormation, experience building automated, versioned migrations and CI/CD (GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline).
  - Observability: practical exposure to Prometheus and Grafana, Elastic/Kibana/ELK/OpenSearch monitoring projects and design work.
  - Containerisation & orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes deployments, container migration experience (mostly on AWS).
  - Migration and platform modernisation experience: multiple large migrations (Oracle Service Bus, WebLogic, Oracle Forms) to cloud (extensive AWS projects) and designing landing zones.
  - SRE/operations experience: long-running on-call/production support and building 24x7 production environments, security and compliance work (WS-Security, SAML, vulnerability analysis).
  - Mentoring/leadership: team lead, training, consulting, workshops and architecture roles across many projects.

- Partial matches (some exposure but not fully aligned):
  - GitOps/ArgoCD: Argo CD appears in KCNA training list (familiarity), but limited evidence of production ArgoCD/Flux-led GitOps adoption.
  - Ansible: stated as basic/educational usage rather than extensive production use.
  - Observability advanced features: OpenTelemetry is in the tech list of the target role; CV shows general observability knowledge but not explicit OpenTelemetry/eBPF production tracing.

- Gaps / Risks (important mismatches):
  - Azure-specific production experience: CV is heavily AWS-centric (many AWS certs and AWS projects). No explicit Azure, Azure DevOps, Bicep or Azure Application Insights production experience is listed ‚Äî this is a key preference for the role.
  - Bicep / Pulumi: not shown; Pulumi is not present and Bicep is not mentioned.
  - eBPF-based tracing & deep Linux kernel observability: no evidence of eBPF tracepoint experience or advanced kernel tracing work.
  - .NET ecosystem: CV focuses on Java, WebLogic, Oracle, Python; little/no evidence of .NET Framework/.NET 8+ experience or Windows/.NET containerisation.
  - Finance/regulatory domain: some public and enterprise projects, but limited explicit fintech/regulatory compliance examples (though security experience exists).

- Overall assessment: Candidate is a senior, highly experienced platform/DevOps engineer with strong Kubernetes, Terraform, observability and cloud migration skills ‚Äî primarily in AWS. For an Azure-first, .NET-heavy fintech migration requiring advanced eBPF tracing and Bicep/Azure DevOps experience there are notable gaps. If the client accepts strong cross-cloud expertise and the candidate can upskill Azure/Bicep and .NET quickly, he is a solid fit; if Azure-native experience and .NET are mandatory from day one, risk is higher.

- Recommendation: Fit score 68/100 (strong match on core platform, IaC and observability; penalty for missing Azure-native, Bicep/Pulumi, eBPF, and .NET experience).
