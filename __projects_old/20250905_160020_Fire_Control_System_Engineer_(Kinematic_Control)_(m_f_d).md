## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-05T16:02:44.448958

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 10/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 10%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'ci/cd', 'python', 'rest', 'integration', 'continuous', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 20/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project: MATLAB/Simulink expertise and control/kinematics background; experience with mechatronic/robotic systems; Embedded C / Embedded Coder / code-gen and C integration (nice-to-have); Python for testing and CI/CD; experience bringing models to lab/field testing; fluent English.
- CV matches/strengths: Very strong systems/architecture and software engineering background; extensive project experience and proven track record; solid Python, CI/CD and DevOps experience (GitLab CI/CD, GitHub, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes); fluent English.
- Major gaps vs. requirements: No evidence of MATLAB/Simulink usage or control/kinematics design; no explicit mechatronics/robotics or embedded-C experience; no Embedded Coder/code-gen or hardware-in-the-loop / lab-control testing experience.
- Partial matches / transferable skills: Strong systems engineering, automation and testing experience ‚Äî could help in CI/CD/testing parts and system integration; fast learner with broad technical background but would require significant ramp-up for control and embedded specifics.
- Conclusion: Good fit for Python/CI/CD/testing/integration tasks but not for the core role of developing and porting stabilization/control algorithms in MATLAB/Simulink or embedded C. Therefore overall fit is low for this position (score: 20/100).
