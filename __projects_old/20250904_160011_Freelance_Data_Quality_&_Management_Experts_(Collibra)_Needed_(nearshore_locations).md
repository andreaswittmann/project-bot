## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-04T16:01:40.692729

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 11/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 11%. Found tags: ['aws', 'amazon', 'ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'sql', 'data', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 50/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements (summary): Data Quality / Data Governance frameworks; hands-on Collibra (preferred) or similar (Informatica, Talend, Ataccama); data lineage & metadata management; data catalog / MDM; SQL & data modelling (energy/utilities); regulatory knowledge (GDPR, REMIT); Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP); German B1+; nearshore locations (Poland/Bulgaria) or remote.

- Strong matches (positive):
  - Extensive cloud architecture and AWS expertise (AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional + many AWS services listed, incl. data services).  
  - Infrastructure as Code and automation skills (Terraform, GitLab/Git/CI-CD, Docker, Kubernetes) ‚Äî useful for cloud data platform implementations.  
  - Solid database experience (Oracle, Oracle DB19c) and SQL-related projects; SAP BW/4HANA infra design shows data-warehousing understanding.  
  - Native German speaker ‚Äî meets language requirement.  
  - Experience with metadata/operations via ESB/OSB, migrations and documentation (some overlap with data lineage/traceability practices).

- Partial / neutral matches:
  - Indirect exposure to metadata and lineage concepts through middleware, ESB and migration projects, but not explicit implementations of data-lineage tools.  
  - Cloud focus is strongly AWS; Azure/GCP experience not documented (client asks for cloud-platform familiarity across providers).

- Gaps / negatives (weaknesses):
  - No explicit Collibra experience and no mention of other dedicated Data Governance/Quality tools (Informatica, Talend, Ataccama) ‚Äî this is a core ask.  
  - No clear Master Data Management (MDM), Data Catalog or enterprise Data Quality project evidence.  
  - No visible experience in the German energy/utilities sector or with sector-specific standards/regulations like REMIT.  
  - GDPR/regulatory compliance knowledge not explicitly stated, though likely given enterprise background ‚Äî not proven.  
  - Client preference for nearshore resources (Poland/Bulgaria) ‚Äî candidate is Hamburg-based; role is 100% remote so this may or may not be acceptable to client.

- Overall reasoning for score (50/100):
  - Candidate brings strong cloud, architecture, database and automation capabilities (valuable for implementing data platforms), and German language skills ‚Äî these are important enablers.  
  - However, the mandatory/priority skill of hands-on Collibra or equivalent Data Governance/Quality tool experience and demonstrated energy-sector/regulatory experience are missing. Those gaps reduce immediate suitability for this specific brief.  
  - With a modest upskilling period or paired team-members who cover Collibra/Data-Governance domain knowledge and energy-specific requirements, the candidate could become a good contributor quickly, but as-is the fit is moderate.
