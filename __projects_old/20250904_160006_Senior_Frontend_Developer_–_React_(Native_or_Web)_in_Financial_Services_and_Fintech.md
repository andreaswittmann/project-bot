## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-04T16:03:37.061673

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 11/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 11%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'ml', 'api', 'rest', 'integration', 'agile', 'data', 'performance', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 20/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project: React (web or React Native), JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/CSS, UI/UX sensibility, Figma/Storybook familiarity, building performant/accessibile UI components, RESTful APIs and async data flows, component libraries/design systems, code reviews, frontend best practices, agile/remote senior role.
- Strong matches (supporting factors in CV):
  - Senior experience and long track record as architect/consultant (fits 'senior').
  - Solid experience with APIs (SOAP/REST) and integration work.
  - Proven experience with agile methods, code reviews, performance tuning and operations (transferable to frontend processes).
  - Comfortable with remote/consulting engagements and rapid upskilling (multiple recent cloud/DevOps certifications and new tech projects).
- Partial/weak matches:
  - Some exposure to HTML (live-scripting) and UI-related workshops historically, but no modern frontend stack evidence.
  - Familiarity with design/UX practices is implied by consulting roles but not demonstrated with tools like Figma or Storybook.
- Major gaps / mismatches:
  - No explicit experience listed with React or React Native.
  - No evidence of modern JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS frameworks, responsive frontend implementations, or component libraries.
  - No stated experience with frontend tooling (Webpack, Babel, Storybook) or mobile UI specifics.
- Assessment rationale: The CV shows a very strong senior engineering/architecture/cloud/DevOps profile with relevant backend/API and performance skills, but it lacks direct, demonstrable experience in React/React Native, JS/TypeScript, modern frontend tooling and design-system work that are core to this role. That makes the candidate a low fit for an immediate hands-on senior React frontend assignment without additional upskilling or proof of recent frontend work.
- Recommendation: Consider for adjacent roles (cloud/devops, API/backend integration, architecture) or if the candidate can quickly demonstrate recent React/TypeScript projects or complete a short technical frontend test/proof-of-concept, re-evaluate fit.
