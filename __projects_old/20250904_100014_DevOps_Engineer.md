### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 24/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 24%. Found tags: ['aws', 'amazon', 'ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'terraform', 'kubernetes', 'container', 'devops', 'ci/cd', 'pipeline', 'jenkins', 'gitlab', 'ansible', 'git', 'integration', 'security', 'compliance', 'continuous', 'deployment', 'linux', 'unix', 'performance', 'remote', 'hybrid', 'freelance', 'projekt']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 80/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the offer: Kubernetes & container orchestration, Unix/Linux administration, CI/CD (Jenkins / GitLab CI), Terraform & IaC, Ansible, cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP), monitoring/ops, security/compliance, German C1 + business English.
- Kubernetes & containers: Strong. CV shows KCNA certification, hands‚Äëon with k3s/Minikube/AWS EKS, Docker and Helm, and deployment/operation experience.
- Unix/Linux administration: Strong. Long history with RHEL, SUSE, AIX, Linux production migrations and operations.
- CI/CD (Jenkins, GitLab CI): Good. Jenkins used in projects; GitLab CI/CD used in a 2019 migration and CI/CD automation work documented.
- Terraform / IaC: Strong. HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate and concrete Terraform scripts / automated deployments in recent projects.
- Ansible: Limited. CV states only "Grundkenntnisse" (basic knowledge) and some hands‚Äëon tests in training ‚Äî potential gap if the role expects advanced Ansible automation.
- Cloud platforms: AWS = very strong (multiple professional certs, broad service knowledge, EKS experience). Azure = not evident in CV (gap if the project uses Azure features). GCP not mentioned.
- Monitoring / observability: Basic to good. Prometheus and Grafana encountered and tested; monitoring responsibilities described in projects.
- Security & compliance: Good. Multiple projects with SSL, SAML, WS‚ÄëSecurity, IAM and AWS security services; experienced with secure deployments.
- Language: Excellent fit. German native; English business fluent.
- Logistics / contract model: Potential concern. Role requires weekly onsite in Lucerne and is an Arbeitnehmer√ºberlassung (temporary employment). Candidate is based in Hamburg and runs a GmbH / consultancy ‚Äî travel willingness and willingness to accept employment via agency should be confirmed.
- Overall assessment: Candidate matches almost all technical must‚Äëhaves (Kubernetes, Linux, Terraform, CI/CD, AWS) with minor gaps (Ansible depth, Azure exposure) and practical uncertainties around onsite cadence and employment model. Hence a strong fit with minor caveats (score 80/100).
