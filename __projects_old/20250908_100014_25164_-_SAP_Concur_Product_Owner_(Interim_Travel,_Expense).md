## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-08T10:02:24.622297

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 11/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 11%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'ml', 'automation', 'database', 'integration', 'compliance', 'continuous', 'data', 'freelance', 'interim', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 40/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements (from the offer):
  - Advanced hands-on experience implementing/configuring/optimizing SAP Concur (Travel & Expense)
  - System integrations, data management and process automation (incl. corporate card integrations)
  - Reporting/compliance framework within Concur, troubleshooting day-to-day operations
  - At least 3 years in a technical/system role in an international organisation (T&E service centre ideal)
  - Strong German and English, 100% presence in Z√ºrich, start ASAP

- Strong matches (from CV):
  - Long track record as technical consultant/architect with deep experience in integrations, automation, reporting and operations (APIs, middleware, AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, scripting)
  - Proven troubleshooting, migration and platform-operations experience and ability to design processes and automation
  - Experience with ticketing/knowledge-base approaches, documentation and training
  - Fluent German and English; independent consultant/owner with broad project leadership experience

- Gaps / risks:
  - No evidence of SAP Concur (or general SAP T&E) hands-on experience in the CV ‚Äî a key requirement for immediate Product Owner delivery
  - No explicit Travel & Expense domain expertise or corporate-card integration references (policy/workflow specifics, compliance, Concur reporting objects)
  - Project expects 100% in Z√ºrich and an immediate start; CV shows Hamburg-based consulting company but no explicit availability/onsite willingness

- Overall assessment: strong technical/integration/operator profile that could transition to a Concur-focused role, but lacks the required, immediate Concur/T&E product experience. Candidate would need ramp-up or to be paired with a Concur SME for an ASAP, 100% Zurich interim Product Owner role.

- Fit score rationale: given very good overlap on technical, integration and operations skills but a critical miss on SAP Concur and T&E domain experience, I rate the fit at 40/100.
