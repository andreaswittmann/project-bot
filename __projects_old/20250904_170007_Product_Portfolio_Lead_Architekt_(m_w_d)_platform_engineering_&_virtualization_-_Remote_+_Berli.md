## Beschreibung
Für unseren Kunden in Berlin suchen wir ab Oktober einen Product Portfolio Lead Software Architekt (m/w/d) Infrastucture / Compute. Die Tätigkeit erfolgt Remote und bis zu 50% vor Ort nach Absprache in Frankfurt oder Berlin. Über die initiale Beauftreagung bis Ende 2025 besteht eine langfristige Verlängerungsoption.

Within IaaS environments, compute architecture defines the foundational software systems that deliver virtualized and containerized compute resources. The architectural strategy in this domain focuses on creating scalable, reliable, and automation-driven platforms that support a broad range of infrastructure workloads and use cases.

Key Architectural Goals and Focus Areas:

• Virtual and Container-Based Compute Platforms
Architecture supports the development of programmable compute services that deliver virtual machines, container
orchestration environments, and hybrid deployment models. This includes designing for high availability,
performance, and multi-tenant isolation.

• OS Image Lifecycle Management
A core objective is to manage the lifecycle of operating system images—including creation, versioning, validation,
distribution, and deprecation—using automated, secure, and policy-driven approaches.
• Microservices and Distributed Systems Design
Compute services are architected as microservices to enhance modularity, scalability, and resilience. Distributed
design principles are applied to support horizontal scaling, failover, and dynamic orchestration of compute
workloads.

• Automation and API-Driven Control Planes
Emphasis is placed on enabling full lifecycle automation of compute resources through robust APIs and integration
with orchestration layers. This ensures seamless provisioning, scaling, health monitoring, and decommissioning.
• Transition and Modernization of Virtualization Layers
Architecture supports strategic transitions—such as moving from traditional hypervisor platforms (e.g., VMware) to
modern, open-source alternatives (e.g., KVM)—ensuring backward compatibility, operational stability, and
performance.

• Security, Extensibility, and Governance
Compute architecture integrates security-by-design principles, including image signing, workload isolation, and
runtime policy enforcement. Extensibility is prioritized to accommodate evolving use cases and platform
integrations.

• Strategic Alignment and Platform Consistency
Compute architecture aligns closely with broader platform strategies, ensuring that all technical decisions support
long-term goals such as standardization, developer enablement, and infrastructure agility.

Ihre Aufgaben:

Profile Requirements
- Proven track record of owning end-to-end architecture across complex systems and lifecycle stages.

- Demonstrated success in driving architectural transitions (e.g., hypervisor migrations, platform redesigns).

Must-have experience
o 7–10 years of professional experience in IT infrastructure, software architecture, or platform engineering.
o In-depth experience in Modular/Distributed Software as well as Highly Available Systems Architecture.
o Experience in Linux & Containers: OS management, Kubernetes.
o In-depth experience of REST APIs, data modeling (relational, document, graph).
o Understanding of virtualization technologies (VMware, KVM).
o Understanding of K8s concepts (namespaces, services, deployments, ingress) and surrounding technologies (e.g.
service mesh).
o Authentication and authorization (IAM, OAuth, OIDC).
o Understanding of Observability concepts (logs, metrics, traces etc.).

Must-have language skills:
o Fluent English in speech and writing (at least C1).
Preferred experience
o Certifications in architecture, cloud infrastructure, or security (e.g. TOGAF, AWS/Azure/GCP certifications) are an

advantage although not required.
o Familiar with:
o Linux OS, imaging, and OS lifecycle management
o Container orchestration (e.g. Rancher, Kubernetes) and service mesh (e.g. Istio, Linkerd, Envoy)
o Artifact signing and workload identity tools (e.g. Sigstore, Cosign, SPIFFE/SPIRE)
o Infrastructure management tools (e.g. Server BMC protocols, DCIM, CMDB systems)
o Understanding of Observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry)

Ort: Remote und nach Absprache bis zu 50% vor Ort Frankfurt oder Berlin
Start: Anfang oder Mitte Oktober
Dauer: Ende 2025 + Option langfristig

Wir freuen uns über Ihre Bewerbung inklusive Angabe des Stundensatzes und Ihrer Verfügbarkeit.

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 82/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements (summary):
  - End-to-end architecture ownership for compute/IaaS, virtual & container compute platforms, OS image lifecycle management, API-first microservices, migrations (VMware -> KVM).
  - Must-haves: 7–10+ years infra/platform architecture, Linux & Containers/Kubernetes, REST APIs & data modelling, virtualization (VMware, KVM), IAM/OAuth/OIDC, observability (logs/metrics/traces).
  - Preferred: Rancher, service mesh (Istio/Envoy), image signing/workload identity (Sigstore/Cosign/SPIFFE), DCIM/BMC/CMDB, Prometheus/Grafana, TOGAF/AWS etc.

- Match vs CV (high level):
  - Strong match:
    - Long track record (~30 years) of system and platform architecture, consulting and driving migrations and lifecycle projects.
    - Cloud & platform credentials: multiple AWS certs incl. Solutions Architect Professional; Terraform Associate; KCNA (Kubernetes & cloud native).
    - Kubernetes/container experience (k3s, EKS, Minikube, Helm, ArgoCD), Docker, container deployments and IaC (Terraform). Practical DevOps/automation experience (CI/CD, SaltStack, GitLab CI/Git).
    - Programming/automation: Python and Bash used repeatedly — good foundation for Python-based architectures and Pydantic adoption.
    - Identity/security experience: SAML, Oracle Identity Manager, WS‑Security — relevant background for IAM/OIDC patterns.
    - Observability: exposure to Prometheus and Grafana (listed as basic knowledge and in KCNA training).
    - Migration experience across OS and platform boundaries (AIX -> RHEL, legacy -> cloud) and designing high-availability solutions.

  - Partial / weaker match:
    - VMware / vCenter: CV does not explicitly list hands‑on VMware/vCenter/vSphere experience (role lists Solaris, AIX, HP‑UX, EC2 etc.).
    - KVM: no explicit mention of KVM-based hypervisor experience or previous VMware→KVM migration projects.
    - Rancher: Kubernetes tooling listed (EKS, k3s, ArgoCD) but Rancher is not explicitly referenced.
    - OS Image Lifecycle Management (creation/versioning/signing/distribution): CV shows related automation and provisioning work but no explicit product/solution for image lifecycle management.
    - Artifact signing / workload identity (Sigstore/Cosign/SPIFFE): not present.
    - DCIM / Server BMC / CMDB operational tooling: not explicit.

- Overall assessment / recommendation:
  - Andreas is a very strong architecture and cloud/platform candidate: solid Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, Python, observability exposure and deep experience running large enterprise infrastructure projects and migrations.
  - Gaps (VMware/vCenter, explicit KVM experience, Rancher, image signing/DCIM tooling) are specific and technical — they can be closed quickly by an experienced architect with Andreas' background, but they are material to the role's mid-term tasks (hypervisor transition, OS image lifecycle).
  - Fit judgement: high (architectural leadership, cloud & K8s skills, security/identity and migration experience) with moderate ramp-up required for a few platform-specific tools and hypervisor migration details.

- Suggested messaging if applying: emphasize recent KCNA, Terraform, AWS Pro certs, EKS/k8s & migration projects (AIX→RHEL, OS migrations), DevOps/IaC work and readiness to lead VMware→KVM and image lifecycle initiatives; propose short discovery phase to validate gaps and ramp plan.
