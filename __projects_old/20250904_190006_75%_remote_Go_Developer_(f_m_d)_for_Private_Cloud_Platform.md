## Beschreibung
For our client we are looking for a Go Developer (f/m/d) for Private Cloud Platform
Start: 06.10.2025Duration: 3 months, + wish for a long-term prolongationCapacity: 100% if possibleLocation: 75% Remote, 25% Berlin (1 week Berlin / 3 weeks remote in rotation), up to 50% onsite in peak timesLanguage: English is a must, German is a plus
Role:The ESL Product Line is responsible for a product portfolio central to the platform, consisting of an Infrastructure as a Service Product, a managed Kubernetes Service, a resource management service to facilitate scalable management of platform permissions and a service lifecycle workflow engine enabling. All services together constitute a core part of an on-premise private cloud platform for all business applications of the client, including IT/OT critical applications required for maintaining and operating the network.For the whole product portfolio, the product line owns the complete product flow, from product management, architecture, delivery up until Tier 3 operations.
Objectives:- Development of go lang based modules for private cloud- Validation regarding quality and functionality of developed code by means of testing and debugging- Conducting of Code Reviews- Contribution to CI/CD Pipeline Maintenance
Skills (must-have):- Minimum of 3 years software development experience (in Go Lang, C/C++ or Python) with significant experience in building RESTful services in distributed environments. The development language of the project is Go and applicantsmust be willing to use it exclusively for the development of the core components.- Experience in Agile and DevOps methodologies for software development.- Experience in the design of scalability and optimized performance, by considering load balancing, caching, and resource allocation.- Experience in system programming, with proficiency in low-level interactions, memory management, and performance optimization.- Experience in troubleshooting and problem solving.- Experience with containerization and container management with Kubernetes, packaging of applications and customization of deployments.- Experience with common hyperscalers (GCP and others). - Experience to set up and manage CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitLab, Jenkins, Tekton, Argo Workflows, and Argo CD as well as hands on experience with gitOps/IaC (supported by our dedicated DevOps engineers).- Experience in writing and maintaining unit and integration tests and their incorporation in automated test frameworks.- Experience within networking concepts, including protocols, load balancing, and security.- Experience in providing documentation for different stakeholders

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 65/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements: Go development (or C/C++/Python >=3y) for RESTful distributed services; exclusive use of Go for core components; Kubernetes/containerization; CI/CD (GitLab, Jenkins, Argo, Tekton, ArgoCD)/gitOps/IaC; scalability, load balancing, performance optimization; system/low-level programming (memory mgmt), networking & security; automated unit/integration tests; English; occasional onsite in Berlin.
- Strong matches from CV:
  - Extensive cloud (AWS) architecture & operations experience, Terraform, CloudFormation, multi-account/landing-zone design.
  - Kubernetes knowledge and hands-on (KCNA, k3s, EKS, Helm, Argo CD present in CV).
  - Containerization (Docker) and packaging experience; many projects using IaC and DevOps practices (SaltStack, Salt, Terraform, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins) and experience building CI/CD and automated tests.
  - Proven experience designing for scalability, high availability and load balancing in enterprise environments and troubleshooting/production support.
  - Strong experience with REST/SOAP services, integration testing, documentation and code/review practices; English fluent.
- Partial / weaker matches:
  - Language: many years of Python and Java; C/C++ experience exists historically (CORBA/C++ around 1998–2000). However, there is no explicit Go experience shown.
  - Hyperscalers: deep AWS experience; no demonstrable GCP experience mentioned.
  - System/low-level programming: CV shows architecture and performance tuning but not recent low-level memory-management focused system programming in Go/C++.
  - Project constraint risk: client requires developers to use Go exclusively for core components — lack of proven Go experience increases ramp-up risk.
- Assessment: candidate is a strong match on cloud-native, Kubernetes, IaC, CI/CD, testing, scalability, and ops aspects. The principal gap is missing demonstrated Go experience (and limited/no GCP/system-programming evidence), which is material because the role expects exclusive Go implementation of core modules. If the candidate is willing and able to pick up Go quickly (given strong Python/Java background), they could be productive fast; otherwise this is a risk for immediate delivery. Score reflects excellent platform/DevOps fit but a notable language/runtime mismatch.
