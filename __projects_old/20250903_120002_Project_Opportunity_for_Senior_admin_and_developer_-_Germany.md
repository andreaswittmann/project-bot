## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-03T12:05:23.328230

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 11/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 11%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'llm', 'openai', 'ml', 'rest', 'enterprise', 'remote', 'hybrid', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 30/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements (from project):
  - Operate and further develop banking applications (SAP New GL, SAP CML, Abakus for development banks)
  - Batch scheduler operation experience (UC4 or TWS/Redwood BPA)
  - Intensive customer contact, strong communication, and ability to train a second employee
  - Hybrid presence (Frankfurt) and 100% freelance availability

- Match vs CV (concise):
  - SAP New GL / SAP CML / Abakus: NOT present. CV shows one SAP-related engagement (architecture for SAP BW/4HANA on AWS) but no operational or functional experience with SAP New GL, CML or Abakus.
  - UC4 / TWS (Redwood BPA): NOT present. CV documents batch framework experience and many batch/J2EE projects, but no explicit UC4/TWS/Redwood knowledge.
  - Banking / ledgers domain: PARTIAL match. Multiple projects for financial services and large enterprise customers (banking/finance clients, SAP BW/4HANA design) indicate domain familiarity, but not specifically with the Abakus product or SAP New GL ledger operations.
  - Operations, automation, DevOps, batch frameworks, migration and high-availability: STRONG match. Long history of operations, IaC, automated deployments, batch frameworks, migrations and system architecture (Oracle/WebLogic, AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, SaltStack, GitLab CI/Jenkins, etc.).
  - Communication & training: STRONG match. Proven trainer/consultant role, workshop experience and explicit trainer certification. Able to train staff.
  - Remote/hybrid and freelance model: MATCH. Located in Germany (Hamburg) and runs own consultancy; hybrid with few onsite days is feasible.

- Assessment rationale and scoring:
  - The project requires specific, operational SAP application expertise (New GL, CML, Abakus) and a specific batch scheduler (UC4/TWS) which are core to the role. These items are largely missing from the CV.
  - The candidate scores highly on operations, automation, DevOps, communication and enterprise project experience ‚Äî useful but secondary to the explicit SAP application requirements.
  - Given critical gaps in core SAP application and scheduler skills, but considering strong adjacent skills and trainability, I rate the fit as 30/100 (low-to-moderate).
