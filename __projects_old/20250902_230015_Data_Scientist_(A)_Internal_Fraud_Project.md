## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-02T23:00:42.083274

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 14/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 14%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'python', 'database', 'sql', 'compliance', 'agile', 'beratung', 'projektmanagement', 'project management', 'data', 'analytics', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 62/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements: strong data-science / predictive-model experience (min. 3 years), Python, SQL, banking experience with Compliance/Risk, modelling-to-production, documentation/change management, project/BA skills, excellent English, Swiss/EU work eligibility and on-site presence.
- Clear matches: MSc (Diplom‚ÄëInformatiker) ‚Äî ‚úÖ; Solid Python and shell experience across many projects ‚Äî ‚úÖ; Strong SQL / Oracle DB experience ‚Äî ‚úÖ; Extensive project/architect/consulting experience and documented PM/BA involvement ‚Äî ‚úÖ; Good banking/financial sector exposure historically and security/compliance work (identity, WS‚ÄëSecurity, audits) ‚Äî partial match; English fluent ‚Äî ‚úÖ; EU nationality (German) ‚Äî meets Swiss legislation eligibility (but currently living in Hamburg; on‚Äësite requirement implies relocation/commute needed) ‚Äî conditional.
- Partial / weak matches: Explicit data‚Äëscience track record (multiple years building, validating and deploying predictive models) is not documented ‚Äî only recent AI/LibreChat, RAG, AWS Bedrock and AWS AI Practitioner certification and conceptual ML knowledge. No clear evidence of hands‚Äëon use of core DS/ML libraries (pandas, scikit‚Äëlearn, TensorFlow/PyTorch), feature engineering for fraud detection, or production model monitoring for fraud use cases.
- Other concerns: The role is on‚Äësite in Zurich and remote from abroad is not allowed ‚Äî candidate would need to confirm willingness to relocate or work from Switzerland. The banking compliance / internal fraud domain expertise appears limited compared with the project requirement for strong Compliance/Risk focus.
- Summary judgement: Candidate is a strong cloud/infra/DevOps/architect with Python/SQL and some AI/ML exposure and relevant banking consultancy background, but lacks demonstrated, multi‚Äëyear hands‚Äëon data‚Äëscience experience and explicit fraud-detection model delivery. That makes them a reasonably good technical contributor but not an ideal direct match for a senior hands‚Äëon Data Scientist focused on internal fraud. Score rationale: weight given to missing core DS experience and on‚Äësite constraint reduces an otherwise strong profile ‚Äî fit_score 62/100.

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-02T23:00:44.675035

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 14/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 14%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'python', 'database', 'sql', 'compliance', 'agile', 'beratung', 'projektmanagement', 'project management', 'data', 'analytics', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 70/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements: university degree in STEM/econ; min. 3 years as Data Scientist (preferably project experience); strong Python and SQL skills; experience in Banking with focus on Compliance/Risk/Internal Fraud; ability to design/validate/monitor predictive models; project management/business analysis experience; excellent English; onsite in Zurich (EU citizens with work permit acceptable).

- Strong matches from CV:
  - Degree: Diplom-Informatiker (equivalent) ‚Äî requirement met.
  - Programming & DB: proven Python usage, extensive Oracle/SQL experience and scripting (bash), CI/CD exposure (GitLab/Jenkins), good tooling/automation background.
  - Cloud/AI/ML-related credentials: recent AWS AI Practitioner, multiple AWS certs, KCNA, Terraform ‚Äî shows up-to-date cloud and AI awareness.
  - Projects: recent private-AI and LibreChat projects, Terraform deployments, AWS Bedrock integration ‚Äî experience with deploying AI solutions and production architectures.
  - Project management / stakeholder work: long history as consultant/architect, engagements with senior stakeholders, agile methods (Scrum/Kanban), documentation practices.
  - Language & eligibility: English fluent; German national (EU) ‚Äî meets Swiss legislation on permitted applicants.

- Gaps / risks:
  - Direct Data Science experience: CV lacks explicit 3+ years labeled ‚ÄúData Scientist‚Äù with hands-on ML model development (feature engineering, scikit-learn/pandas, model validation/metrics, production monitoring examples are not shown).
  - Domain-specific fraud/compliance experience: limited explicit evidence of internal fraud detection, regulatory compliance or risk-modeling in banking (some banking/finance projects exist but not focused on fraud/compliance).
  - Onsite availability: candidate is Hamburg-based; client requires on-site work in Zurich ‚Äî EU citizen status is fine, but candidate's willingness/ability to be onsite (relocate/commute) is not stated.

- Overall assessment: Strong candidate for roles that emphasize cloud architecture, data engineering, AI/ML infrastructure and stakeholder-facing analytics; borderline for a hands-on internal-fraud data scientist role unless the candidate can demonstrate concrete ML model development, fraud-domain experience and confirm Zurich on-site availability.

- Recommendation: Proceed if candidate can provide examples of hands-on ML modelling (code, projects, metrics) and confirm ability to work onsite in Zurich. Fit score: 70/100.
