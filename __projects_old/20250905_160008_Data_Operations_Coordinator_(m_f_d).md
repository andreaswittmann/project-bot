## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-05T16:07:03.956678

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 19/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 19%. Found tags: ['ai', 'cloud', 'grafana', 'architect', 'architecture', 'automation', 'python', 'shell', 'scripting', 'git', 'api', 'rest', 'database', 'sql', 'integration', 'agile', 'continuous', 'consultant', 'data', 'etl', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 50/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements (summary): ensure daily data flows / ETL operations; lead/co-ordinate developers; incident & ticket management; documentation (ITIL4); strong MSSQL (Linked Servers, SSIS, T-SQL, stored procs) + SSRS; PostgreSQL & data-warehouse understanding; scripting (Python, shell); Azure + Azure Data Factory; Grafana dashboards; data transport (S)FTP, REST, RabbitMQ.
- Strong matches from CV:
  - Leadership / coordination / consulting: extensive experience as architect, team lead and consultant across many projects and clients (highly relevant).
  - Data flow / ETL & integration experience: many projects with Oracle Service Bus / ESB, migrations of integration platforms and automated deployments ‚Äî practical experience with enterprise data flows and integration patterns.
  - Scripting & automation: explicit Python and bash experience; Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and CI/CD knowledge ‚Äî strong for automation requirements.
  - Incident / ticketing / process: experience with Jira, ticket systems, support/production handovers and operational documentation ‚Äî fits incident management and ticket prioritization.
  - Data transport & APIs: experience with SOAP/REST and SFTP-style integrations in projects; familiarity with related operational concerns.
  - Monitoring / visualization: basic knowledge of Prometheus/Grafana and monitoring concepts (exposed in "Weitere Kenntnisse").
- Important gaps / weak or missing areas:
  - MSSQL-specific stack (SSIS, SSRS, T-SQL, Linked Servers, stored-procedures) is not demonstrated in the CV (CV shows strong Oracle/Oracle DB experience instead).
  - Azure platform / Azure Data Factory: CV shows deep AWS expertise (Landing Zones, many AWS services) but no explicit Azure/Azure Data Factory experience.
  - PostgreSQL / Data Warehousing: general DB and SAP BW architecture experience exists, but no explicit hands-on PostgreSQL/data-warehouse tooling like columnar stores, OLAP-specific implementations or modern DW platforms.
  - RabbitMQ: not mentioned; messaging experience shown (ESB/OSB) but RabbitMQ-specific experience not documented.
  - ITIL4: documentation aligned to ITIL4 was requested; CV shows operational/process discipline but no explicit ITIL4 certification or explicit mention.
- Risk assessment: candidate brings strong integration/ETL/process and leadership skills plus scripting/automation and monitoring familiarity, but lacks several explicitly required platform/stack skills (MSSQL/SSIS/SSRS and Azure/ADF) that are central to the role.
- Recommendation: Good candidate for coordination/architecture/operations roles where platform can be flexible (or if client accepts Oracle/AWS background and on-the-job ramp-up). For a role requiring immediate, hands-on MSSQL/SSIS/SSRS + Azure Data Factory expertise, the candidate would require a short ramp-up or complementary team members.
- Scoring rationale: high marks for soft skills, integration experience and automation (‚âà80/100 on those axes) but significant deductions for missing core platform skills (MSSQL/SSIS/SSRS and Azure/ADF) and RabbitMQ/Postgres specifics. Combined, this yields an overall fit score of 50/100.
