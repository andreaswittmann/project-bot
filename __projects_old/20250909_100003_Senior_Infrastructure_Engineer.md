JOB & PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
As part of our client's Tech Transformation 2.0 initiative, our client is upgrading their technology stack and accelerating automation across core systems. The in parts newly assembled tech & product team plays a critical role in building scalable, efficient, and modern solutions to replace manual workflows, boost delivery speed and increase efficiency overall. In addition, the team is working on transforming the business into a true platform model.

We are looking for a hands-on Senior Infrastructure Engineer to maintain and optimize our sophisticated hybrid infrastructure environment. You will manage enterprise-grade Windows Server infrastructure with Hyper-V clustering, Storage Spaces Direct, and SQL Server Always On, while integrating modern Azure cloud services. You will operate with high autonomy across multiple Hetzner datacenters and Azure tenants.

What you'll do:
- Maintain & optimize Multinode Hyper-V clusters with Storage Spaces Direct (NVMe/HDD tiers) and failover clustering across multiple datacenters
- Manage SQL Server Always On availability groups, clustering, and mirroring with dedicated high-performance networks
- Automate infrastructure operations with PowerShell scripting, Ansible playbooks, and Bicep templates for Azure resources
- Monitor & respond to infrastructure alerts using Grafana/Prometheus/Loki stack, and Azure Application Insights
- Implement VLAN segmentation, Network QoS policies, and BitLocker encryption across all critical systems
- Deploy & manage containerized applications via Docker with automated CI/CD pipelines from Azure DevOps to on-premises
- Execute live migrations, cluster maintenance, and zero-downtime procedures while maintaining SLA compliance
- Plan & execute capacity planning, management and expansion; storage scaling, and multi-datacenter backup strategies with automated replication
- Ensure ISO 27001 compliance monitoring, security event analysis, and comprehensive documentation

Who we're looking for:
- Deep Windows expertise: Demonstrable mastery of Windows Server clustering, Storage Spaces Direct architecture, SMB multichannel optimization, and PowerShell automation; ability to troubleshoot complex failover scenarios and storage performance issues
- 5+ years experience with Hyper-V clustering, SQL Server Always On, and enterprise Windows infrastructure in production environments
- Expert knowledge of failover clustering (CSV, fault domains, quorum), Storage Spaces Direct (tiered storage, resiliency), and high-availability architectures
- Solid experience with Azure services (DevOps, Monitor, Active Directory), Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/ARM), and hybrid cloud integration
- Hands-on expertise in enterprise networking (VLANs, QoS), SSL certificate management, and security monitoring
- Strong understanding of SQL Server clustering, Always On availability groups, database mirroring, and backup/recovery strategies
- Proven track record managing mission-critical infrastructure with 99.9%+ uptime requirements and comprehensive disaster recovery
- Ability to work self-directed in complex enterprise environments, handle critical incidents, and communicate clearly in English (C1/C2)
- Nice to have: Experience with Hetzner datacenters, IIS administration, Wazuh SIEM, and container orchestration (Docker/Portainer)

## 🤖 AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T12:10:56.271486

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 29/100
- **Threshold:** 15/100
- **Result:** ✅ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 29%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'docker', 'container', 'prometheus', 'grafana', 'monitoring', 'architect', 'architecture', 'devops', 'ci/cd', 'pipeline', 'automation', 'infrastructure as code', 'ansible', 'shell', 'scripting', 'database', 'sql', 'enterprise', 'integration', 'security', 'ssl', 'compliance', 'encryption', 'continuous', 'data', 'performance', 'clustering', 'failover', 'remote', 'hybrid', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 45/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 89/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the brief:
  - Deep Windows Server expertise incl. Hyper-V clustering, Storage Spaces Direct (S2D), SMB multichannel, failover clustering
  - SQL Server Always On/AGs, mirroring, DB backup/DR
  - PowerShell automation, Ansible, Bicep (IaC) and Azure (DevOps, Monitor, AD)
  - Monitoring with Grafana/Prometheus/Loki, SLA/DR, ISO27001/security monitoring
  - Docker container deployments and CI/CD (Azure DevOps -> on-prem)
  - Enterprise networking (VLANs, QoS), BitLocker, multi-datacenter ops

- Match vs CV (evidence / gaps):
  - Windows Server & clustering: Partial match. CV shows Windows Server experience historically (2003/2008) and broad HA architecture work (WebLogic, Oracle RAC), but no explicit Hyper-V, S2D or SMB multichannel experience.
  - SQL Server Always On / MS-SQL: Weak match. CV documents extensive Oracle/Oracle RAC and database work, but no explicit MS SQL Server Always On/AG/mirroring experience.
  - PowerShell: Weak/Not shown. Automation examples use Python, bash, SaltStack, GitLab CI, Terraform; PowerShell is not documented.
  - Ansible: Basic knowledge listed ("Grundkenntnisse").
  - Bicep / Azure IaC / Azure DevOps: Weak. Strong cloud/IaC experience but primarily AWS + Terraform; Azure resources (Control Tower etc.) are not featured, Bicep not mentioned, Azure DevOps not shown.
  - Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki): Basic familiarity stated; hands‑on experience appears limited to tests/installations and coursework rather than deep production ownership.
  - Docker / containers: Good match. Docker and container work present (LibreChat, private AI, Kubernetes training) and CI/CD experience exists (GitLab CI/CD, etc.).
  - Networking, VLANs, QoS, BitLocker: Partial/weak. AD integration experience exists; explicit VLAN/QoS and BitLocker implementations not shown.
  - Security / ISO27001 / SIEM: Partial. Strong security concepts (SAML, WS-Security, workshops) but SIEM tools (Wazuh) and ISO27001 compliance monitoring not explicitly demonstrated.
  - Data center / multi-site operations (Hetzner): Mixed. Many multi-datacenter and enterprise infra projects (on-prem -> cloud) but no explicit Hetzner experience.

- Overall assessment and reasoning for score (45/100):
  - Strengths: 30+ years infra/architecture experience, strong high-availability and enterprise systems background, AWS/cloud and Terraform expertise, container experience (Docker, Kubernetes training), automation mindset, monitoring awareness.
  - Primary gaps: core role requires deep, hands-on Microsoft ecosystem skills (Hyper-V clustering, Storage Spaces Direct, SQL Server Always On, PowerShell, Azure/Bicep) which are not evidenced in the CV. Several "nice-to-have" items (Hetzner, Wazuh, IIS, BitLocker, Bicep) are missing or weak.
  - Conclusion: Candidate is a strong senior infrastructure architect/engineer for Linux/AWS/Oracle/WebLogic/containerized environments and automation, but would need upskilling/time to cover the Microsoft/Hyper-V/SQL-Server/Azure-specific requirements for this role. Score reflects a solid overall infra skillset but material mismatches on the job's core Windows/Hyper-V and MS SQL responsibilities.
