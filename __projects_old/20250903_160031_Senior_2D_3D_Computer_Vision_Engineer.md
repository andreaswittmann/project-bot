We are looking for a Senior 2D/3D Computer Vision Engineer to build the core technology that makes our platform possible. The central challenge is to automatically generate clean, geometrically accurate, and simplified 3D roof models from raw aerial Digital Surface Models (DSM) and RGB data.

As the owner of this domain, you will:
‚Ä¢ Define the Process: Take charge of the entire ML pipeline, from R&D to production. This includes refining the annotation process and enhancing our existing Three.js-based 3D annotation tool to build a high-quality, large-scale dataset.
‚Ä¢ Build the Models: Research, develop, and train a suite of models to handle roofprint segmentation, structured prediction of planar roof wireframes from point clouds, and detection/classification of roof obstructions (chimneys, pipes, windows, etc.).
‚Ä¢ Ship to Production: Engineer a scalable and robust inference pipeline that can process new properties on demand.
Our stack is Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, Rasterio/GDAL, and JavaScript/Three.js for the annotation tool. We are looking for a pragmatic and experienced engineer who loves tackling complex 3D vision problems. You should be comfortable with both 2D and 3D data (especially point clouds and geospatial imagery) and have a proven track record of delivering end-to-end ML solutions.

## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-03T16:03:05.688594

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 12/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 12%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'ml', 'cloud', 'pipeline', 'python', 'git', 'api', 'lean', 'data', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 20/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the offer:
  - Strong experience in 2D/3D computer vision (DSM, RGB, point clouds) and research-to-production ML model development (roof segmentation, planar wireframe extraction, obstruction detection).
  - Hands-on with PyTorch, Python ML stack, data processing for geospatial imagery (Rasterio/GDAL), point-cloud processing.
  - Backend/service experience for inference deployment (FastAPI or similar), scalable pipeline engineering, productionization.
  - Frontend annotation tool work with JavaScript/Three.js to build/enhance labeling tooling and datasets.
  - End-to-end ownership: annotation, model training, evaluation, and shipping inference pipelines.

- Matches found in the CV:
  - Extensive senior engineering and architecture experience; proven owner of complex technical domains and delivery to production.
  - Strong DevOps/cloud skills: AWS (many certifications), Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes (KCNA), CI/CD, scalable infra ‚Äî valuable for production inference pipelines.
  - Solid Python usage across multiple projects (automation, scripting, integrations) and experience with building reproducible deployments and tests (GitLab CI/CD, Live-Scripting).
  - Experience designing data/infra for enterprise workloads, security, monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana knowledge), and automated operations.
  - English fluent.

- Major gaps vs. the role:
  - No demonstrated hands-on experience with computer vision model development (no PyTorch, CV research, segmentation, wireframe prediction evidence).
  - No evidence of geospatial tooling experience (Rasterio/GDAL), DSM/orthophoto or point-cloud processing (e.g., PDAL, PCL, Open3D) or prior work with LiDAR/point clouds.
  - No evidence of FastAPI (or similar REST inference service) or building ML model serving endpoints.
  - No JavaScript/Three.js or annotation tool development experience documented.
  - ML/CV-specific publications, datasets, or model training at scale (esp. 3D roof modeling) are missing ‚Äî steep ramp for research/algorithmic parts.

- Overall assessment / recommendation:
  - The candidate is a very strong senior cloud/DevOps/engineering architect who can design and ship scalable production pipelines and infrastructure (high value for productionization and MLOps).
  - However, the role requires deep, hands-on 2D/3D computer vision and geospatial model development (PyTorch, point clouds, Rasterio/GDAL, Three.js) which are not demonstrated in the CV. Expect a significant onboarding period or the need to pair this candidate with a CV researcher/engineer.

- Suggested fit decision: Good fit for ML/Ops/infra ownership, poor fit for immediate solo delivery of the CV research and model-building tasks. (Score: 20/100)
