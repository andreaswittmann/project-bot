- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 10%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'rest', 'enterprise', 'authorization', 'lean', 'projektmanagement', 'project management', 'training', 'remote', 'hybrid', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 30/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from project offer:
  - Senior SAP ARIBA developer: hands-on implementation/customizing of Ariba modules (Catalogs, Guided Buying, Contract Management, Reporting)
  - SAP ERP configuration/customizing (MM module, company codes, G/L accounts, tax codes, cost centers)
  - Procurement domain knowledge (preferably in credit institutions)
  - Authorization concept / roles analysis and implementation, test scenarios and cutover
  - Stakeholder coordination, training, and project management
  - Immediate availability for a ~2-year freelance engagement (mostly remote, occasional onsite in Frankfurt)

- Matches in the CV:
  - Very strong enterprise architecture and integration background across many large projects
  - Extensive consulting / advisory / project management and training experience
  - Proven experience with cutovers, testing, migrations and stakeholder coordination
  - Security/authorization experience (SAML, WS-Security, IAM-related topics) and strong automation/DevOps/cloud skills (AWS, Terraform, CI/CD)

- Gaps vs. project needs:
  - No SAP Ariba experience listed (core requirement)
  - No explicit SAP ERP / MM module customizing or SAP-specific implementation experience
  - No demonstrated procurement domain experience in banking/credit institutions (required domain knowledge)
  - No explicit experience with Ariba-specific activities: catalog integrations, negotiated rate cards implementation, Ariba Contract Management, Ariba reporting

- Overall assessment / rationale:
  Andreas brings strong, transferable architecture, integration, cloud and project-management skills that would help in many enterprise IT projects. However, this role demands hands-on SAP Ariba and SAP ERP/MM expertise plus procurement-domain experience ‚Äî which are not present on the CV. Due to the absence of the core Ariba/SAP-ERP skills and procurement background, the candidate is a low-to-moderate fit despite solid transferable competencies.

- Recommendation: Consider only if the client is willing to accept a senior integration/architect who will require time/partnering to ramp on Ariba/SAP specifics; otherwise prioritize candidates with direct Ariba + SAP ERP/MM experience.

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 10/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 10%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'rest', 'enterprise', 'authorization', 'lean', 'projektmanagement', 'project management', 'training', 'remote', 'hybrid', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 30/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements: SAP Ariba implementation (catalog connections, negotiated/internal catalogs, guided buying/forms), Ariba Contract Management, SAP ERP configuration (MM module integration), authorization/role design in Ariba, reporting, centralization/cutover of entities, training, and project management; domain knowledge of purchasing processes in credit institutions.

- Matches from CV: long senior IT/architecture experience; proven track record in migrations, cut‚Äëover to production, integrations and middleware; strong cloud/automation/DevOps skills (AWS, Terraform, CI/CD) useful for deployment and integration tasks; experience with security/authorization concepts (SAML/WS‚ÄëSecurity) and conducting training/workshops and project coordination.

- Major gaps vs. requirements: no explicit SAP Ariba experience or Ariba module implementations listed; no evidence of hands‚Äëon SAP ERP MM configuration/customizing (only an AWS infra concept for SAP BW/4HANA); limited explicit experience with procurement/purchasing processes in banks or contract management in a procurement context.

- Assessment: candidate is strong for architecture, integration, cloud, automation, security and cutover responsibilities, but lacks the core functional and technical Ariba/SAP MM expertise required for a senior Ariba developer who must configure Ariba modules and handle procurement processes end‚Äëto‚Äëend. Upskilling or pairing with an Ariba SME would be necessary.

- Recommendation: fit score 30/100 ‚Äî good adjacent skill set but insufficient specific Ariba/SAP MM experience for this senior developer role.
