## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-05T19:01:30.541224

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 12/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 12%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'architect', 'api', 'rest', 'integration', 'consultant', 'data', 'analytics', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 15/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project offer:
  - Adobe Analytics (general + technical): data collection, reporting setup
  - Adobe Target (general + technical): personalization, A/B testing, implementations
  - Tealium tag management and data layer configuration
  - Adobe Meta Conversion API (CAPI) integration knowledge
  - Exposure to other Adobe Experience Cloud technologies
  - English language, 100% remote, UK business hours, freelance/contracting

- Match against CV (Andreas Wittmann):
  - Strong match: Extensive freelance/consulting background, long track record with enterprise projects; fluent English; proven cloud/DevOps skills (AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes), automation, scripting, CI/CD and tagging/monitoring basics (Prometheus/Grafana - basic); comfortable with remote/consulting engagements.
  - Weak / no match: No explicit experience or projects listed for Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Tealium, Adobe Meta Conversion API (CAPI) or other Adobe Experience Cloud products; no demonstrated experience in web analytics implementation, client-side tag/data-layer work, or A/B testing platforms.

- Assessment / recommendation:
  - The role requires specialists in Adobe Analytics/Target and tag-management (Tealium/CAPI). The CV demonstrates excellent cloud, middleware and DevOps architecture skills but lacks the core Adobe analytics/target/tag-management experience demanded by this posting.
  - Candidate could potentially ramp up given broad technical background, but would need training or prior hands‚Äëon Adobe/Tealium projects to be an immediate match.

- Fit rationale summary: Core functional skills required (Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Tealium, CAPI) are absent from the CV, so despite strong adjacent technical strengths the immediate fit is low. Score: 15/100.
