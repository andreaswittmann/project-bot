**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-03T13:02:44.803898

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 10/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ✅ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 10%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'rest', 'enterprise', 'authorization', 'lean', 'projektmanagement', 'project management', 'training', 'remote', 'hybrid', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 30/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project:
  - Hands‑on SAP Ariba implementation & customization (catalog connections, negotiated/internal catalogs, Guided Buying forms)
  - SAP ERP configuration/customizing (MM module, G/L accounts, tax codes, cost centers) and company‑code centralization
  - Authorization concept/roles analysis, design, testing and cutover
  - Contract Management module setup and upload/migration of existing contracts
  - Reporting definition and report creation for test/prod
  - Training for purchasing users and overall project management (status calls, coordination)

- Comparison against CV (Andreas Wittmann):
  - Seniority & delivery experience: ~30 years in IT, architecture, consulting and project leads — STRONG MATCH
  - Project management & stakeholder coordination: multiple consulting engagements with architecture and delivery responsibilities — GOOD MATCH
  - Integration / middleware / catalog‑like work: extensive experience with ESB/Oracle Service Bus, SOAP/REST, migrations and integrations — PARTIAL MATCH (relevant technical skill set, but not Ariba‑specific)
  - Authorization/security: experience with SAML, WS‑Security, single sign‑on and security reviews — PARTIAL MATCH (experience in security concepts transferable to authorization design)
  - SAP experience: one project designing SAP BW/4HANA on AWS (architecture level) — LIMITED MATCH (no evidence of SAP MM or functional procurement experience)
  - SAP Ariba / Contract Management: NO explicit hands‑on Ariba or contract management experience documented — MAJOR GAP
  - Reporting & training: general reporting/monitoring and consulting experience exist; training delivery experience is plausible — PARTIAL MATCH
  - Location/engagement: Hamburg‑based, senior freelance with recent cloud/AI projects; hybrid Frankfurt onsite requirement (2–3 days/month) is feasible.

- Assessment summary:
  Andreas is a highly experienced senior architect/consultant with strong integration, security and cloud/DevOps skills and proven project delivery capability. However, the role requires deep hands‑on SAP Ariba and SAP ERP (MM/procurement) domain knowledge which is not demonstrated in the CV. He could serve as a technical/integration lead or architect in a team that includes an Ariba functional specialist, but for a standalone senior SAP Ariba developer role the domain gap is significant.

- Recommendation: Consider only if the client accepts pairing him with a dedicated Ariba/MM functional expert or if the client values integration/architect skills over direct Ariba experience.

Fit score rationale: major domain gap (Ariba/MM) plus good transferable skills => fit_score 30/100.

- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 30/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements:
  - Hands-on SAP Ariba implementation/customizing (catalogs, guided buying forms, Contract Management)
  - SAP ERP (MM) configuration, company-code centralization, GL/tax/cost-center integration
  - Authorization/role analysis, test scenarios and cutover to production
  - Reporting creation and training for purchasing users
  - Project management and stakeholder coordination in a procurement/credit‑institution context

- Matches from CV:
  - Seniority & delivery experience (~30 years) and proven consulting/project leadership — GOOD MATCH
  - Strong integration/middleware background (OSB, WebLogic, ESB, SOAP/REST), migration experience and cutover work — PARTIAL MATCH (relevant for Ariba↔ERP integration)
  - Security/authorization experience (SAML, WS‑Security, security reviews) — PARTIAL MATCH (conceptual transfer to authorization design)
  - Reporting/monitoring and training experience documented — PARTIAL MATCH
  - Comfortable with hybrid/remote engagement and enterprise environments — GOOD MATCH

- Major gaps vs. requirements:
  - No documented hands‑on SAP Ariba experience (catalogs, guided buying, Ariba Contract Management) — MAJOR GAP
  - No hands‑on SAP MM/procurement configuration experience; only architectural SAP BW/4HANA work — MAJOR GAP
  - No explicit procurement domain experience in credit institutions (tax/GL/cost‑center specifics) — GAP
  - No evidence of creating Ariba-specific reports or performing Ariba cutovers/migrations — GAP

- Conclusion / recommendation:
  - Andreas is a strong candidate for integration/architecture, security or cloud/DevOps tasks within an Ariba program, or as a technical lead paired with an Ariba/MM functional specialist.
  - For a standalone senior SAP Ariba developer role (hands‑on Ariba + MM ownership) his domain gap is significant.

- Suggested fit score rationale: high transferable technical & leadership skills offset by lack of core Ariba/MM experience -> fit_score = 30/100
