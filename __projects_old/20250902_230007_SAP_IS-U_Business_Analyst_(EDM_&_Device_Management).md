## 🤖 AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-02T23:07:25.404309

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 11/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ✅ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 11%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'llm', 'openai', 'architect', 'agile', 'data', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'jira', 'confluence']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 12/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the offer:
  - Deep domain knowledge in energy/utilities, specifically Device Management (SLP, RLM, kME) and smart metering
  - Experience with Energy EDIFACT messages (UTILMD, MSCONS, etc.) and data flows (EDM)
  - Good knowledge of SAP IS‑U / S/4HANA and end‑to‑end device management processes
  - Agile delivery, creation of user stories/epics, acceptance criteria; tools: Jira, Confluence
  - Very good German; 60–70% on‑site availability (Frankfurt & Munich)

- Match with CV (Andreas Wittmann):
  - Strong senior IT architecture/consulting background, long experience in analysis, requirements, stakeholder management and documenting solutions
  - Demonstrated agile/DevOps experience (Scrum/Kanban, pair programming, IaC, CI/CD) and familiarity with Jira/Confluence
  - Native German and strong communication skills
  - Relevant technical strengths in integration, middleware, cloud (AWS), Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes and data/integration tooling
  - Some SAP-related work: designed SAP BW/4HANA infrastructure on AWS (architecture-level exposure)

- Major gaps / mismatches:
  - No explicit SAP IS‑U or S/4HANA device-management experience listed
  - No evidence of EDIFACT messaging experience (UTILMD, MSCONS) or smart‑metering domain expertise
  - No explicit experience with SLP/RLM/kME processes or regulatory specifics of utilities
  - Role is a domain-centric BA position; missing core domain and message-format skills are critical

- Short assessment and recommendation:
  - The candidate scores well on general architecture, integration, cloud and agile delivery, but the role requires specialist utility domain and SAP IS‑U/EDM knowledge that are not present in the CV.
  - If the client can provide domain onboarding/training and is willing to accept a technically strong integration/architecture consultant transitioning into IS‑U BA work, the candidate could be considered; for a straight SAP IS‑U EDM & Device Management business analyst hire, fit is low.

- Numerical reasoning for the score (concise):
  - Domain & SAP IS‑U expertise are weighted heavily for this role and are effectively missing -> large penalty
  - Agile/tools/language/architecture strengths provide a small positive offset
  - Resulting fit score: 12/100 (low match primarily due to missing domain/message-format/SAP IS‑U experience)
