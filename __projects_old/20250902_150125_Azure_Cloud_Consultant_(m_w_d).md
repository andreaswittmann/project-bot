## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-02T15:01:46.136503

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 11/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 11%. Found tags: ['ai', 'cloud', 'terraform', 'container', 'monitoring', 'infrastructure as code', 'security', 'compliance', 'consultant', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **Fit Score:** 65/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- **Skills and Technologies Required**: The project requires expertise in Microsoft Azure, Terraform, Cloud Computing, Incident Response, and Secure Score & Policy development. 
- **Skills and Technologies Matched**:
  - Andreas Wittmann has extensive experience with Terraform from his certifications and project work (e.g., HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate, various projects listed in the CV).
  - Cloud Computing experience is well established through multiple AWS certifications and projects.
  - Though direct experience with Microsoft Azure is not explicitly mentioned, his extensive background in cloud technologies with AWS and other platforms suggests a potential to adapt to Azure.
  - Incident Response and security controls are partially matched with his AWS security understanding, but are less emphasized compared to Azure-specific requirements.
- **Key Gaps**:
  - Direct experience with Microsoft Azure, particularly in the specific areas of Azure Secure Score, Sentinel, and AKS, is not mentioned in the CV.
  - Incident response and security implementations specific to Azure container services like AKS, which require more Azure-centric security expertise.
- Overall, while there is strong general cloud and security experience, the lack of direct Azure expertise affects the fit score.
