## 🤖 AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-08T13:02:24.009357

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 13/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ✅ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 13%. Found tags: ['aws', 'amazon', 'ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'argo', 'cicd', 'git', 'github', 'security', 'consulting', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 71/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements extracted:
  - Advanced GitHub Actions (security) and CI/CD integration (ArgoCD)
  - Practical Travis CI knowledge
  - Alerts / reporting across repos and modules
  - Cloud security knowledge (GCP, Azure, AWS)
  - Secure development lifecycle (SDLC)
  - Nice-to-have: Go (reading scripts)

- Match vs CV (concise):
  - GitHub Actions (advanced security): Partial — CV shows active GitHub usage and a GitHub Copilot certification and broad CI/CD experience (GitLab CI, Jenkins, AWS Code*), but no explicit GitHub Actions projects. (score: 12/20)
  - Travis CI: Weak — Travis is not mentioned; strong CI knowledge is transferable but no practical Travis evidence. (score: 2/10)
  - ArgoCD-based CI/CD: Good — ArgoCD is explicitly listed in 2024 tooling and KCNA/Kubernetes experience is present. (score: 18/20)
  - Alerts & reporting across repos: Good — monitoring/alerting experience (Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, ELK exposure) and CI reporting/automation background. (score: 13/15)
  - Cloud security (GCP, Azure, AWS): Partial — deep and certified AWS security/architecture expertise; little-to-no explicit Azure or GCP experience cited. (score: 12/20)
  - Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC): Strong — several security-related projects, workshops, WS-Security/SAML/patching and vulnerability remediation experience. (score: 14/15)
  - GoLang (nice-to-have): Low — Go is not listed; candidate has many other languages (Java, Python, Bash) so reading simple Go scripts is likely feasible but not demonstrated.

- Overall assessment: The candidate is a strong fit on AWS, ArgoCD/Kubernetes, CI/CD and security practices/SDLC and monitoring. Gaps are explicit hands-on Travis CI experience, and missing/limited proof for Azure and GCP cloud security and advanced GitHub Actions security work. These gaps reduce the fit for a role that expects multi-cloud security knowledge and specific CI tools.

- Scoring method: weighted per requirement (total 100) based on criticality; summed subscores -> final fit_score = 71/100.
