## ðŸ¤– AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-05T16:07:51.889436

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 13/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** âœ… Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 13%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'architect', 'architecture', 'git', 'rest', 'agile', 'scrum', 'kanban', 'consultant', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'jira', 'confluence', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 85/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** âœ… ACCEPTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements: `Requirements engineering` for leasing, technical analysis, creation/maintenance of user stories, Agile (Scrum/Kanban), tools: `Jira`, `Confluence`, `MS Excel`, occasional `Postman`; good English; domain experience in leasing/financing/banking desirable; IREB certification a plus; React/Angular/Java an advantage.
- Strong matches: ~30 years in architecture/consulting with repeated requirements/architecture analysis, system design and documentation; long history with Java/J2EE and enterprise systems (clear advantage for technical discussions and answering developer questions); explicit experience with Agile methods (Scrum, Kanban), Jira and ticketing/wiki systems, pairing with development teams; finance/banking/insurance domain experience across multiple projects; fluent English.
- Partial / weaker matches: No explicit IREB Requirements Engineering certification; leasing-specific projects not explicitly listed (but relevant banking/finance work exists); modern frontend frameworks (React/Angular) not shown in CV; `Postman` and `Confluence` are not explicitly named (has wiki/Trac, extensive documentation practices), so some tooling ramp-up may be needed.
- Overall assessment: Candidate is a strong technical Requirements Engineer / Technical BA fit because of deep technical background, domain experience and Agile practice. Remaining gaps are mostly certification and a few modern frontend/tool specifics which are low-risk to close.
- Score rationale: 85/100 â€” high match on core technical, process and domain aspects; minor deductions for missing explicit IREB, leasing-specific mention and frontend/Postman tooling experience.
