## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T13:07:18.880239

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 20/100
- **Threshold:** 15/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 20%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'ml', 'kubernetes', 'docker', 'container', 'architect', 'architekt', 'architecture', 'architektur', 'devops', 'automation', 'python', 'enterprise', 'agile', 'linux', 'coaching', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 52/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 89/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements (from project):
  - Mandatory: C# / .NET, Angular, German C1/native, ‚â•5 years leading dev teams, deep understanding of SOA/Microservices and DevOps/IT Ops, Windows & Linux servers
  - Important: Container tech (Docker, Kubernetes), ERP experience (ideally Odoo)
  - Nice-to-have: Python, ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)

- Match vs CV (concise):
  - C# / .NET: Not present in CV ‚Äî no explicit experience ‚Üí 0/25
  - Angular: Not present in CV ‚Äî no explicit experience ‚Üí 0/20
  - Leadership / coaching (‚â•5 years): Strong track record as architect/consultant/team lead/mentor and founder ‚Üí full match (15/15)
  - SOA / Microservices & software architecture: Extensive experience (OSB, WebLogic, ESB, SOA, migration/architecture work) ‚Üí full match (10/10)
  - DevOps / IT Ops, Container tech, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, Cloud: Strong modern cloud and DevOps skills (AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes/K3s/EKS, Docker, Saltstack/Ansible knowledge, GitLab/Jenkins/GitHub, IaC) ‚Üí strong match (15/15)
  - Windows & Linux servers: Proven experience across Linux (RHEL, SLES, CoreOS) and Windows historically ‚Üí match (5/5)
  - ERP / Odoo: Has SAP BW/4HANA and SAP on AWS experience (ERP-like) but no Odoo experience ‚Üí partial (2/5)
  - Python & ML frameworks: Python experience and AWS AI/Bedrock/SageMaker knowledge; no explicit TensorFlow/PyTorch projects, so partial ‚Üí (0 implicit in main weighting, noted as partial)

- Overall assessment summary:
  - Strengths: senior architect/DevOps/cloud-native expertise, leadership and coaching, strong AWS/Terraform/Kubernetes/CI-CD experience, German native, broad enterprise background.
  - Gaps: Missing the two stated mandatory frontend/backend stack items (C#/.NET and Angular). Also lacks explicit Odoo and explicit TensorFlow/PyTorch hands-on experience.
  - Fit implication: Excellent for a Tech-Lead role focused on architecture, DevOps and cloud transformation; however, if the role requires hands-on C#/.NET + Angular delivery by the lead, the candidate would not meet those mandatory requirements.

- Score rationale: weighted scoring prioritises mandatory C#/.NET and Angular (both missing) while crediting strong matches in leadership, DevOps, architecture and cloud, yielding a fit score of 52/100.
