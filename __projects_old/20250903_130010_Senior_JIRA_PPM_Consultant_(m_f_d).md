### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 14/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 14%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'rest', 'enterprise', 'integration', 'agile', 'consultant', 'projektmanagement', 'project management', 'data', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'jira', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 45/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project: 10+ years JIRA Cloud administration/customization; deep expertise with PPM/RCP add-ons (BigPicture, Structure, Tempo/Tempo Capacity); portfolio/project/agile management experience; resource capacity planning (allocation, utilization, reporting); data migration/integration with enterprise systems (e.g., ServiceNow, OKR tools); strong stakeholder/communication skills.
- Match ‚Äî JIRA experience: Partial. CV states usage of Jira for agile project management (Scrum/Kanban), task/workflow management and documentation, but does NOT document 10+ years of hands-on JIRA Cloud administration or customization.
- Match ‚Äî PPM / RCP add-ons: Weak / Missing. No explicit experience with BigPicture, Structure by Tempo or Tempo Capacity/Resource Planning is listed.
- Match ‚Äî Portfolio / Project / Agile: Good. Long track record as architect/consultant, delivery in agile environments (Scrum, Kanban) and creation of POCs, workshops and Landing Zones ‚Äî indicates solid PM/portfolio understanding.
- Match ‚Äî Resource capacity planning & reporting: Partial. CV shows experience with monitoring, reporting tools (Prometheus/Grafana basics) and AWS cost/capacity considerations, but no explicit RCP implementation or utilization-tracking with Tempo/BigPicture.
- Match ‚Äî Data migration & integrations: Good for integrations generally. Strong history of migrations and integrating middleware/enterprise systems (OSB, Service Bus, Service integrations, AWS integrations). However, no explicit ServiceNow or OKR-platform integration examples are given.
- Match ‚Äî Jira admin tasks (workflows, permissions, dashboards, add-on management): Partial. Candidate has used Jira for processes but no explicit evidence of administering Jira Cloud, managing add-ons, or performing large-scale JIRA data migrations.
- Match ‚Äî Stakeholder management & communication: Strong. Many consulting roles, workshops, training and senior advisory positions indicate excellent stakeholder skills.
- Risk summary: Candidate brings strong enterprise architecture, migration, integrations, DevOps and agile consulting experience ‚Äî good cultural/consulting fit. Major gaps are the lack of explicit JIRA Cloud administration history at senior (>10y) level and no demonstrated hands-on experience with the specific PPM/RCP add-ons required. These are likely critical for rapid ramp-up in this role.
- Recommendation: Candidate is a plausible contender for a slightly broader PPM/PPM+integration consultancy role, but for this role (senior JIRA PPM Consultant with immediate hands-on add-on expertise) expect ramp-up time or the need to verify hands-on add-on experience in an interview or via references.

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 35/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project offer:
  - Senior JIRA Cloud administration & customization (10+ years)
  - Deep expertise in PPM / RCP add-ons (BigPicture, Structure, Tempo Capacity/Resource Planning)
  - Portfolio / project / resource capacity planning & reporting (allocation, utilization tracking)
  - Data migration into JIRA and integration with enterprise tools (ServiceNow, OKR platforms, reporting tools)
  - Configure workflows, permissions, dashboards, fields, reports; support interface development
  - Strong stakeholder management and ability to advise technical and business leaders

- Relevant matches in the CV:
  - Very strong senior consultancy / architecture background and stakeholder experience across many enterprise projects (nearly 30 years)
  - Practical experience with agile delivery (Scrum, Kanban) and use of Jira as an agile/project management tool (stated in "Weitere Kenntnisse")
  - Broad experience with migrations, integrations and data-driven projects (Oracle/OSB/Forms migrations, AWS migrations, CI/CD automation) which demonstrates transferable skills for migration planning
  - Strong cloud, automation and tooling skills (AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, monitoring) that are useful for integrations and large-scale environments

- Gaps / weaknesses vs. the role:
  - No evidence of 10+ years of hands-on JIRA Cloud administration or deep customization experience (CV only states "used Jira in various projects")
  - No mentions of the required PPM/RCP add-ons (BigPicture, Structure, Tempo) or hands-on configuration of those plugins
  - No explicit ServiceNow or OKR-platform integration experience, nor explicit reporting-tool integration examples (only general integration/migration experience)
  - No concrete examples of designing JIRA-specific workflows, permission schemes, advanced dashboards or user-interface customizations

- Rationale / recommendation:
  - The candidate is a highly experienced senior IT consultant and cloud/DevOps architect with good familiarity with Jira as a tool and strong migration/integration experience. Those transferable skills are valuable, especially for enterprise process and tooling projects.
  - However, the assignment demands deep, hands-on, JIRA-Cloud-specific admin and PPM add-on expertise (and an explicit history of working with BigPicture/Structure/Tempo and ServiceNow integrations). Those specific capabilities are not evidenced in the CV.
  - If the role can accept a senior consultant who will pair with a hands-on JIRA/PPM specialist (candidate as solution architect/lead), this could work. For a pure solo hands-on Senior JIRA PPM Consultant expected to lead all Jira/PPM configuration and integrations immediately, the candidate is a weak fit.

- Fit score justification (0-100): 35
  - +25 points: seniority, stakeholder management, migrations/integrations, agile experience (transferable)
  - +10 points: explicit Jira usage and comfort with tooling/automation
  - -40 points: missing/insufficient evidence for 10+ years of JIRA Cloud admin, no proof of BigPicture/Structure/Tempo hands-on experience, no explicit ServiceNow/OKR/reporting integrations
  - Net: ~35 (not a strong direct match; suitable as architect/consultant in a team but not as a standalone hands-on Senior JIRA PPM Consultant)
