### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 55/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project offer:
  - Degree in Economics/Banking/Data/Digital Engineering or related field; fluency in English
  - Minimum ~3 years' experience as fraud specialist or in similar fraud detection role
  - Strong banking/domain experience with Solution Design, Fraud, Compliance, Risk and Legal frameworks
  - Hands-on analytics: design/implement fraud scenarios, execute analyses, reporting
  - Project management / business analysis experience; strong documentation skills
  - CFE certification preferred; agile / collaborative soft skills

- Match with CV (Andreas Wittmann):
  - Education: Diploma in Computer Science ‚Äî related technical background (acceptable for Data/Digital roles)
  - Domain: Extensive consulting experience in finance/banking historically (multiple projects with banks and financial services)
  - Solution design & architecture: Very strong ‚Äî decades of architecture, cloud (AWS), IaC (Terraform), Kubernetes, DevOps experience
  - Security & compliance: Several security-related projects (SAML, WS-Security, identity management, security workshops) and secure deployments
  - Project management / business analysis: Proven consultant/architect role responsibilities, pre-sales, mentoring, documentation and delivery of complex projects
  - Analytics & platform: Familiarity with monitoring/logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK), many AWS data/AI services and recent AWS AI Practitioner / GitHub Copilot certifications; built AI/RAG proof-of-concepts (LibreChat, Bedrock)
  - Languages & soft skills: German native, English fluent; long consulting career implies collaborative/agile capabilities

- Major gaps / mismatches:
  - No explicit track record as a Fraud Specialist or several years of direct fraud-detection operational experience
  - No Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) or explicit legal/fraud-regulatory certification
  - Limited evidence of hands-on fraud-analytics (statistical/ML fraud models, rule engines, typical fraud platforms) despite AI/cloud experience
  - The most recent direct banking-fraud domain experience is not shown ‚Äî most recent work is infrastructure, cloud, and AI tooling

- Overall assessment / recommendation:
  - Andreas is a strong technical/solution architect and cloud/DevOps leader well suited to design and implement the infrastructure, monitoring, secure data flows and platform components for fraud-detection systems.
  - He is less well suited as the primary domain expert for operational fraud detection, rules modelling or investigations without a partner who has explicit fraud-analytics and compliance/legal domain experience.

- Fit rationale summary: strong technical, cloud, security and delivery skills + relevant banking background, but lacks direct fraud-specialist experience and CFE ‚Äî good for architecture/implementation role on a fraud project, weaker for a role that requires proven fraud analytics/operations expertise.

- Suggested fit score (0-100): 55
