## Beschreibung
We are currently looking for a freelance OpenSearch Expert (m/f/d) for our client in the IT sector.

Start:31.12.25
Capacity: fulltime
Location: remote CET worktime

Tasks:
Our current eco system and internal product “OctoBus” is based on Elastic components, including Elasticsearch, Logstash, Beats (as Logshipper) which is globally deployed on distributed Kubernetes clusters that are provisioned via Helm and Jenkins. The main motivation for the project placement is to potentially shift from Elastic to OpenSearch and to evaluate how a transition can smoothly be done (evaluation of things that might break, features we might miss, boundaries to tackle on the migration). To achieve this we have the demand direct OpenSearch hands-on, where we know it’s quite rare in the market, however can easily be adapted with recent deeper knowledge of Elastic (having deployed / configured / administrated the Elastic stack, formerly commonly called ELK).

Must-have:
ElasticSearch(expert level), OpenSearch (big plus), Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD

Nice-to-have:
Helm and Jenkins

## 🤖 AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-08T13:01:29.889078

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 12/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ✅ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 12%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'kubernetes', 'docker', 'helm', 'ci/cd', 'jenkins', 'integration', 'continuous', 'linux', 'consulting', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 70/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements:
  - Expert Elasticsearch (must), OpenSearch (big plus)
  - Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (must)
  - Logstash, Beats, distributed Helm/Jenkins deployment (context)
  - Migration evaluation experience (assess breakage, missing features)

- Matches from CV:
  - Kubernetes & Cloud-native: KCNA (2024), hands-on with k3s, EKS, Minikube, kubelet, kubectl, Helm v3 — strong
  - Container tooling: Docker listed across projects and in 2025 LibreChat work — strong
  - Linux: long history (RHEL, SUSE, Oracle Linux, AIX, HP-UX) — expert
  - CI/CD & automation: GitLab CI/CD (2019), Jenkins mentioned (2021 OSB project), Terraform, Saltstack/Ansible exposure — solid
  - Elasticsearch/stack exposure: designed monitoring using ElasticSearch + Kibana + Grafana (2015–2017) — relevant familiarity
  - Migration & architecture experience: many migrations and cross-platform projects (Oracle Service Bus, OSB, Oracle Forms) — strong systems-architecture & migration skills

- Gaps / Risks:
  - No explicit recent, deep Elasticsearch admin/operational evidence at "expert" level (most Elastic work appears monitoring-focused and older)
  - OpenSearch not mentioned — no proven hands-on experience migrating Elastic->OpenSearch
  - Logstash / Beats (shippers) not explicitly shown as hands-on experience
  - Project asks for rare, direct OpenSearch hands-on expertise — this is the main hiring need and the candidate’s coverage here is unclear

- Overall assessment:
  - Candidate is a strong match for Linux, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, Helm/Jenkins and migration/architecture tasks and has Elastic-stack familiarity. However, lack of explicit recent Elasticsearch operations at expert level and no demonstrated OpenSearch hands-on experience reduce the fit for a role that requires direct OpenSearch expertise. Score reflects strong adjacent skills but some specificity gaps for the core requirement.
