## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-04T16:07:27.394383

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 15/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 15%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'ci/cd', 'pipeline', 'automation', 'shell', 'scripting', 'rest', 'enterprise', 'integration', 'security', 'compliance', 'continuous', 'deployment', 'consulting', 'hybrid', 'freelance', 'projekt']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 30/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements (from project):
  - Proven experience with Microsoft Intune / Endpoint Manager
  - Manage Windows 10/11, macOS, iOS, Android endpoints
  - PowerShell scripting for automation
  - CI/CD processes, device provisioning (Autopilot, Apple DEP)
  - Microsoft security stack (Defender for Endpoint, Conditional Access, Azure AD)
  - MDM/MAM policies, hybrid Intune + SCCM environments
  - AD / Group Policy / Azure AD experience
  - Ticketing (ServiceNow) and ITIL processes
  - German & English communication

- Matches (evidence in CV):
  - Strong automation and scripting experience (Python, bash, SaltStack, some Ansible exposure)
  - Solid background in enterprise infrastructure, patching, OS upgrades, large-scale deployments and security (SSL, WS-Security, key management, patch plans)
  - Experience with CI/CD tooling and pipelines (GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, Git)
  - Active Directory integration experience in multiple projects
  - Extensive experience with Windows Server, enterprise operations and documentation/IT processes
  - German native, English fluent

- Partial / Related experience (transferable):
  - Device lifecycle concepts, provisioning and automated deployments demonstrated for server/platforms (could translate to endpoint provisioning)
  - Experience with monitoring and security tooling (Prometheus/Grafana familiarity, AWS security services) ‚Äî conceptually relevant to endpoint security

- Gaps / Missing or not demonstrated:
  - No explicit Microsoft Intune / Endpoint Manager hands-on experience (critical requirement)
  - No explicit PowerShell experience shown (PowerShell is listed as a must for automation)
  - No explicit experience with Autopilot, Apple DEP, or mobile OS management (iOS/macOS/Android MDM)
  - No evidence of Defender for Endpoint, Conditional Access, or Azure AD conditional policies
  - No SCCM / hybrid Intune+SCCM experience
  - No explicit ServiceNow or ITIL certification/experience mentioned

- Assessment summary / recommendation:
  - The candidate is a very senior, experienced cloud/infrastructure architect with strong automation, security and enterprise operations background. However the role requires hands-on Intune/endpoint and PowerShell expertise plus mobile/modern device provisioning and Microsoft security tooling ‚Äî concretely absent from the CV. These are core requirements for an Endpoint Management Engineer and reduce immediate fit for a full-time onsite Intune role.
  - If the client is open to a senior infrastructure consultant who can ramp into Intune quickly (due to deep automation and AD/security experience), this candidate could be considered with a short onboarding period. For a plug-and-play Intune specialist the fit is low.

- Final fit score rationale: 30/100 ‚Äî strong transferable infrastructure and automation skills but missing the mission-critical hands-on Intune, PowerShell and modern endpoint management experience required for this position.
