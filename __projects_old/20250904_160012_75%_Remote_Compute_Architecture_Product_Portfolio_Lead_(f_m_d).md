## Beschreibung
For our client we are looking for a Compute Architecture Product Portfolio Lead (f/m/d).
Start: 06.10.2025Duration: 3 months, + wish for a long-term prolongationCapacity: 100% if possibleLocation: 75% Remote, 25% Berlin (1 week Berlin / 3 weeks remote in rotation), up to 50% onsite in peak timesLanguage: English, German is a plus
Role:The Infrastructure Product Line provides infrastructure services through a hardware and software stack to support tenants and other product lines. These services primarily encompass network, compute, and storage segments.Within IaaS environments, compute architecture defines the foundational software systems that deliver virtualized and containerized compute resources. The architectural strategy in this domain focuses on creating scalable, reliable, and automation-driven platforms that support a broad range of infrastructure workloads and use cases.
Tasks:Key Architectural Goals and Focus Areas:- Virtual and Container-Based Compute Platforms- OS Image Lifecycle Management- Microservices and Distributed Systems Design- Automation and API-Driven Control Planes- Transition and Modernization of Virtualization Layers- Security, Extensibility, and Governance- Strategic Alignment and Platform Consistency
Objectives:-Define and own the architecture for the Compute Product Portfolio-Architect a scalable and secure OS Image Lifecycle Management solution/Driving architectural design for the transition from VMware to KVM-Consulting with Product Management, Delivery, and peer architects to ensure alignment with product strategy-Ensuring all architecture adheres to platform security, observability, and governance standards-Prioritizing of architectural efforts based on business impact, technical complexity, and interdependencies
Skills (must-have):- 7‚Äì10 years of professional experience in IT infrastructure, software architecture, or platform engineering.- In-depth experience in Modular/Distributed Software as well as Highly Available Systems Architecture.- Experience in Linux & Containers: OS management, Kubernetes.- In-depth experience of REST APIs, data modeling (relational, document, graph).- Understanding of virtualization technologies (VMware, KVM).- Understanding of K8s concepts (namespaces, services, deployments, ingress) and surrounding technologies (e.g. service mesh).- Authentication and authorization (IAM, OAuth, OIDC).- Understanding of Observability concepts (logs, metrics, traces etc.).
Skills (should-have):- Certifications in architecture, cloud infrastructure, or security (e.g. TOGAF, AWS/Azure/GCP certifications)- Linux OS, imaging, and OS lifecycle management- Container orchestration (e.g. Rancher, Kubernetes) and service mesh (e.g. Istio, Linkerd, Envoy)- Artifact signing and workload identity tools (e.g. Sigstore, Cosign, SPIFFE/SPIRE)- Infrastructure management tools (e.g. Server BMC protocols, DCIM, CMDB systems)- Understanding of Observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry)

## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-04T16:01:26.467558

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 28/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 28%. Found tags: ['aws', 'amazon', 'ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'kubernetes', 'k8s', 'container', 'prometheus', 'grafana', 'architect', 'architekt', 'systemarchitekt', 'architecture', 'architektur', 'automation', 'api', 'rest', 'security', 'iam', 'authentication', 'authorization', 'deployment', 'linux', 'consulting', 'data', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 80/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements (from the project):
  - Senior infra/platform architecture experience (7‚Äì10+ years) and product/portfolio leadership.
  - Linux, Containers, Kubernetes (K8s concepts: namespaces, services, deployments, ingress).
  - OS Image Lifecycle Management (imaging, patching, lifecycle automation).
  - Virtualization knowledge and migration (VMware ‚Üí KVM) and general virtualization layers.
  - Automation and API-driven control planes; REST APIs and data modelling experience.
  - Service mesh and container orchestration management (Istio, Rancher etc.).
  - Authentication/authorization (IAM, OAuth, OIDC).
  - Observability concepts and tools (logs, metrics, traces; Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry).
  - Governance, security, HA/distributed systems and infrastructure tooling (CMDB, DCIM, BMC protocols).

- Matches in the CV:
  - Very strong architecture and product/consulting background with ~30 years experience and leadership roles (founder, principal consultant).
  - Explicit, recent cloud & infra certifications: AWS Solutions Architect Pro, Terraform Associate, KCNA (Kubernetes & cloud native).
  - Hands-on cloud and container experience: Docker, EKS, k3s, Minikube, Helm, ArgoCD, AWS EC2/EBS/ECR/ECS/EKS, Terraform, Salt/Ansible knowledge.
  - Observability exposure and practical usage: Prometheus and Grafana referenced; Elastic/Kibana experience for monitoring/logging.
  - OS lifecycle and migration work: multiple projects migrating applications/OS (AIX‚ÜíRHEL, Oracle Forms migration, patch plans, automated provisioning).
  - Automation/DevOps experience: IaC, CI/CD (GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins), scripted automation (Python, bash), Live-Scripting approach.
  - Security/identity background: SAML 2.0, WS-Security, Oracle Identity Manager, and broad AWS IAM knowledge.
  - Experience designing HA, distributed, and modular systems across many enterprise environments.

- Gaps / risks vs. the role requirements:
  - No explicit modern hands-on mention of VMware ‚Üí KVM migration projects or explicit KVM admin experience (virtualization experience is broad but not specifically KVM/VMware in recent projects).
  - Service mesh and management stacks: Istio, Linkerd, Envoy or Rancher are not shown as hands-on project experience (KCNA gives conceptual knowledge but limited explicit Istio/Rancher references).
  - Artifact signing / workload identity tools (Sigstore, Cosign, SPIFFE/SPIRE) are not present in the CV.
  - DCIM, BMC protocols, CMDB systems are not clearly documented‚Äîthese are listed as "should-have" for the role and represent a potential gap.
  - OpenTelemetry explicit implementation experience is not listed (observability concepts present and tooling like Prometheus/Grafana noted).
  - TOGAF or explicit enterprise architecture certification not shown (though architecture experience is extensive).

- Overall assessment / recommendation:
  - Strong match on core must-haves: senior architecture background, Linux/containers/Kubernetes knowledge, automation/IaC, observability concepts, REST APIs and security/identity experience.
  - Main gaps are a lack of explicit, recent hands-on VMware‚ÜíKVM migration, explicit Istio/Rancher/service-mesh operational experience, and no mention of Sigstore/SPIFFE/DCIM/CMDB tooling.
  - Given the candidate's depth in cloud-native, DevOps, and architecture, and strong AWS/Terraform/Kubernetes credentials, he is a good fit for the role with some moderate risks that can be mitigated quickly through short ramp-up or leveraging his broad platform experience.

- Fit rationale summary: strong alignment for product-architecture leadership (80/100).
