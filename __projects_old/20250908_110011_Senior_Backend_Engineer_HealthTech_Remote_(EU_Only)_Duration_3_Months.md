## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-08T11:00:41.646168

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 26/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 26%. Found tags: ['aws', 'amazon', 'ai', 'ki', 'ml', 'cloud', 'kubernetes', 'prometheus', 'grafana', 'monitoring', 'architect', 'architekt', 'architecture', 'architektur', 'devops', 'pipeline', 'automation', 'python', 'api', 'rest', 'sql', 'continuous', 'scalability', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 72/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements (summary): Kotlin (Hibernate), Postgres, GraphQL, REST APIs, Kubernetes (EKS), AWS (S3, SQS, CloudWatch), event-driven (RabbitMQ or SQS), Prometheus & Grafana, DevOps/CI-CD/automation, senior backend + strong DevOps, English (required), German (nice).

- Strong matches:
  - AWS: multiple recent AWS certifications (incl. Solutions Architect ‚Äì Professional) and many hands‚Äëon AWS projects; explicit familiarity with services listed (S3, SQS, CloudWatch and many others).
  - Kubernetes: KCNA certification and practical work with k3s, EKS and related tooling.
  - DevOps / Automation / IaC: Terraform, CloudFormation, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, SaltStack, Live‚ÄëScripting, Experience building automated deployments and IaC practices.
  - Monitoring/Observability: knows Prometheus and Grafana (basic/used in workshops/tests) and broad monitoring experience across projects.
  - Messaging / event-driven systems: extensive messaging background (Oracle Service Bus, JMS, WebSphere MQ) and prior SQS usage on AWS ‚Äî good conceptual fit for event architectures.
  - Backend engineering & architecture: ~30 years as architect/consultant, hands‚Äëon with distributed, high‚Äëavailability systems and API integration (REST/SOAP).
  - Python & AI: relevant recent AI projects (LibreChat, AWS Bedrock) and Python experience ‚Äî aligns with the "nice to have" AI/Python tooling.
  - Language & remote: fluent English and German (plus EU remote OK).

- Gaps / risks:
  - Kotlin: CV shows strong Java/J2EE background but no explicit Kotlin experience. Transition likely feasible but not proven in CV.
  - GraphQL: not mentioned in CV; experience appears focused on REST and SOAP.
  - Postgres: main DB experience is Oracle and AWS-managed DBs; Postgres not explicitly listed.
  - Hibernate: JPA/Hibernate not explicitly stated, though Java EE experience suggests ORM familiarity but not confirmed.
  - RabbitMQ: messaging experience is strong but RabbitMQ specifically is not listed (SQS and enterprise MQs are present).
  - Frontend (React): not shown in CV (nice to have only).

- Overall assessment: Candidate is a strong senior cloud/DevOps/backend architect with excellent AWS and Kubernetes credentials and relevant monitoring and messaging experience. However, the engagement requires specific hands‚Äëon Kotlin + GraphQL + Postgres expertise for immediate productivity; those language/stack specifics are not evidenced in the CV. Given high overlap on cloud, DevOps, observability and messaging (important for the role) but missing explicit Kotlin/GraphQL/Postgres work, I rate the fit as 72/100.
