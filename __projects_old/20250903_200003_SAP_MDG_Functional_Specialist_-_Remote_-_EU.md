## 🤖 AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-03T20:00:25.719527

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 10/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ✅ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 10%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'enterprise', 'integration', 'workshop', 'data', 'etl', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 15/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements (from project):
  - 12+ years SAP MDG experience with >=3 full-cycle MDG implementations — NOT present in CV
  - Deep domain expertise in Material Master (MDG-M) and other MDG domains — NOT present
  - MDG mass processing, consolidation, data quality management, central governance — NOT shown
  - MDG data modelling, UI modelling, rule-based workflow, validation/derivation — NOT shown
  - SAP ETL processes / Master Data Integration / One Domain Model / MDG cloud modes — NOT shown
  - BRF+ and ABAP Object-Oriented (including BADI) — NOT present
  - Integration with SAP Ariba — NOT present
  - Experience across multiple MDG solutions (MDG-M, MDG-C, MDG-BP, etc.) — NOT present
  - Conducting design-thinking workshops, requirements workshops, leading teams, stakeholder communication — PARTIALLY PRESENT (extensive consulting, workshops, training and leadership experience)
  - Ability to design data management strategies for on‑prem and cloud — PARTIALLY PRESENT (strong cloud architecture / AWS experience and data/service integration background)
  - Coordinate across geographies / onsite-offshore teams — PARTIALLY PRESENT (international clients and consulting engagements)

- Comparison / assessment summary:
  - Andreas Wittmann is a senior architect/consultant with ~30 years experience in middleware, SOA/ESB, WebLogic/Oracle stacks, cloud (AWS), DevOps (Terraform, CI/CD), and integrations. He brings strong architecture, operations, and cloud-native skills that are relevant for integration and platform aspects of master-data landscapes.
  - The project is explicitly SAP MDG functional specialist work requiring deep, hands-on SAP MDG domain and SAP-ERP technical skills (Material Master domain expertise, ABAP/BRF+, BADI, MDG-specific modelling and implementations, Ariba integration). These core skills and specific MDG implementation experience are not present in the CV.
  - Transferable strengths (architecture, data/integration thinking, workshop facilitation, cloud/automation) mitigate risk somewhat but would not replace the required SAP MDG functional and ABAP knowledge expected for immediate delivery.

- Recommendation / rationale for score:
  - Because the role is highly specialist and SAP-MDG-centric, absence of direct SAP MDG and ABAP/BRF+ experience is a critical mismatch. The candidate could be considered for ancillary roles (integration, cloud/landing-zone, DevOps support) or after a significant ramp-up/training period, but is not a good immediate fit for a 100% SAP MDG Functional Specialist engagement. Hence a low fit score.

- Fit score explanation: 15/100 — strong on architecture, integrations and cloud; insufficient/absent SAP MDG domain and ABAP/BRF+ competencies required by the project.
