### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 14/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 14%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'architect', 'enterprise architect', 'architecture', 'api', 'enterprise', 'integration', 'compliance', 'beratung', 'consulting', 'workshop', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **Fit Score:** 70/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- **SAP Integration Expertise**: The project requires extensive senior-level experience in SAP Integration Suite. Andreas Wittmann's CV does not explicitly mention SAP Integration experience, which is a critical gap.
- **Enterprise Architecture**: The project demands a strong understanding of enterprise architecture principles. Wittmann's CV demonstrates significant experience in architecture roles, indicating a good fit for this requirement.
- **Consulting Skills**: The project highlights the need for exceptional consulting skills. Wittmann's extensive experience as an IT consultant aligns well with this requirement.
- **Communication Skills**: The project necessitates strong communication skills. Wittmann's role as a trainer and his consulting history support the assertion that he likely possesses these skills.
- **German Language**: The project requires very good written and spoken German. Given that German is Wittmann's native language, this requirement is well met.
- **Technologies and Tools**: While the CV lists broad experience with various IT technologies and tools, it does not specifically mention SAP IS-U or SAP Applications, which is another critical gap.
- **Remote and On-Site Work**: The project requires flexibility with a significant on-site presence. Although Wittmann's recent projects do not specify the work setup, his Hamburg residence may pose logistical challenges for on-site work in Frankfurt and Munich.
