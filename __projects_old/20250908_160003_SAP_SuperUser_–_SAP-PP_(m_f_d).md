## Beschreibung
Our client is looking for a SAP SuperUser (m/f/d) in the SAP-PP / production planning environment

As the SAP Super User for Production, you will be the central pillar of our clients operational execution within SAP. Your mission is to ensure our teams can leverage SAP to its fullest potential, acting as the crucial bridge between end-users, management, and our IT teams.

You will not only execute complex production workflows yourself but also empower the entire organization to do so effectively.

You are a true SAP expert with deep, hands-on experience as an end-user in Production (PP) modules. You thrive on not only mastering the system's complexities yourself but also on teaching, supporting, and enabling others.

In our fast-paced environment, characterized by dynamic designs and ever-changing bills of materials (BOMs), you will provide the stability, knowledge, and support needed to keep our operations running smoothly. You will be the first point of contact, the primary trainer, and the process optimization champion for all things related to Production SAP.

Start: asap
Auslastung: 100%
Ort: M√ºnchen (Ostbahnhof bzw. Werksviertel, sehr gut angebunden) & Remote (mind. 20%)
Laufzeit: 3 - 6 Monate

Ihre Aufgaben
Training and Support: Serve as the subject matter expert for all SAP production processes. You will train end-users on the complete workflow, from demand planning (MRP) to production order confirmations, providing ongoing support to troubleshoot issues.
Communication Liaison: Act as the primary link between operational end- users and management/IT. You will gather and communicate user feedback, system issues, and functional requirements to ensure user needs are effectively addressed.
Process Improvement: Proactively identify inefficiencies in our current workflows. You will leverage your deep user-level understanding to recommend and help implement process improvements, particularly for managing our dynamic hardware designs and evolving BOMs.
Implementation Support: Play a key role in the successful adoption of new system functionalities. You will assist in user testing, validation, and training sessions to ensure a seamless transition for any system enhancements.
Documentation and Knowledge Management: Create, maintain, and own the documentation for SAP processes, including standard operating procedures (SOPs), work instructions, and training materials to foster a culture of continuous learning and system proficiency.
Issue Resolution: Be the first point of contact for end-users experiencing difficulties within the SAP PP modules. You will provide immediate solutions for common issues and escalate complex problems to the appropriate support teams when necessary.

Unsere Anforderungen
End-to-End Production Cycle: Proven, hands-on ability to manage the production lifecycle: creating and confirming production orders in detail, issuing goods to production, and ensuring accurate system transactions.
Core SAP Functions: Proficiency in managing master data (materials, vendors, etc.).
User-Centric Expertise: You must be a genuine "Super User" with a history of performing these functions in your daily work, not just a consultant or high- level implementer.
Adaptable Environment: Experience working in an engineering or manufacturing setting with dynamic product designs and frequently changing BOMs is highly preferred.
Englisch Skills (at least Level B2)
