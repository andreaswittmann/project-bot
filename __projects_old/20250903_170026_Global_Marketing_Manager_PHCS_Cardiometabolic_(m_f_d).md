Global Marketing Manager PHCS Cardiometabolic (m/f/d) : healthcare / Diagnostics / Cardiometabolic / Leadership and Influencing Capabilities / Communication and Collaboration / English
Project:
For our customer Roche Diagnostics International AG based in Rotkreuz we are looking for a highly qualified

Global Marketing Manager PHCS Cardiometabolic (m/f/d).
Background:

At Roche, we are passionate about transforming patients' lives and fearless in both decision and action. We believe that good business means a better world, and that's why we come to work every day. We are committed to scientific rigor, unassailable ethics, and access to medical innovations for all. Our purpose is to make a lasting impact on patients' lives, and this drive is reflected in everything we do.

As a global leader in diagnostics, Roche offers innovative solutions that shape the future of healthcare. By partnering with pharmaceutical companies, we aim to bring next-generation diagnostics to market, accelerating drug development and improving patient outcomes. In this role, you will contribute to the Cardiometabolic portfolio, supporting groundbreaking medical advancements for patients worldwide.

This is a unique opportunity to join the Roche Diagnostics Core Lab team in a role dedicated to a specific Personalized Healthcare Solutions (PHCS) function. While a part of the core business, this position is focused on a collaborative partnership with a pharmaceutical company to establish their drug as a foundational treatment for high-risk CVD patients. This is achieved by leveraging Roche's hs-CRP assay as a critical residual risk prognostic marker, directly addressing systemic inflammation to improve cardiovascular outcomes. As the Global Marketing Manager, you will be a key driver in creating a compelling narrative and raising awareness around hs-CRP testing. You will lead a comprehensive marketing strategy to support the collaboration's objectives, which includes a focus on patients with evidence of ASCVD and CKD, and an hs-CRP level greater than 2mg/L in secondary prevention settings.

The perfect candidate:

We are looking for an exceptional candidate who is passionate about delivering high-impact diagnostic solutions and transforming patient outcomes in collaboration with our pharma partners. You are someone with a solid scientific or marketing background, paired with strong business acumen. You thrive in dynamic environments, where collaboration is key, and you are always looking for innovative solutions to challenges. Your strong leadership, communication, and strategic thinking skills will help you inspire others to achieve results, while always focusing on value creation and customer satisfaction.

Tasks & Responsibilities:

- Marketing Strategy & Execution: Lead the design and execution of global marketing campaigns and initiatives to create a compelling narrative around hs-CRP testing. Including:
- Creating a Market research presentation on needs, challenges, and opportunities.
- Developing an unbranded hs-CRP campaign for endorsement.
- Building a Messaging framework and Lexicon guide.
- Generating campaign content for endorsement.
- Leading the creation of educational materials, website content, and webinars.
- Developing a comprehensive congress engagement plan.

- Commercialization & Lifecycle Management:
- Drive commercialization strategies and direct engagement with key regions and prioritized affiliates of our pharma partner.
- You will act as a catalyst for local collaborations, enabling a successful market entry and increasing utilization of the hs-CRP test within the context of Cardiovascular Risk.
- This includes marketing context supporting market development, product positioning within cardiovascular risk and the prognostic value of the biomarker to increase adoption of hs-CRP as a standard biomarker used to identify patients with systemic inflammation
Must Haves:
- Degree in a scientific or marketing related field, paired with strong business acumen
- At least 5+ years of experience as Marketing Manager in healthcare, ideally in Diagnostics with Cardiometabolic experience
- Understanding of pharmaceutical collaborations, which would support an easier transition into the role
- Excellent Communication and Collaboration Skills to work effectively in a team across global teams and external partners
- Strong Leadership and Influencing Capabilities to drive alignment and execution of product strategies
- Passion for Customer and Patient-Centric Solutions and a drive for continuous improvement
- Thriving in dynamic environments, where collaboration is key, and always looking for innovative solutions to challenges
- Fluent in English
