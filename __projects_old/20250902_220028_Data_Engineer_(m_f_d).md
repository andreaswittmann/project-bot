## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-02T22:02:24.723813

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 20/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 20%. Found tags: ['ai', 'architect', 'architekt', 'architecture', 'architektur', 'ci/cd', 'pipeline', 'python', 'git', 'rest', 'integration', 'agile', 'continuous', 'deployment', 'consultant', 'data', 'streaming', 'scalability', 'performance', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **Fit Score:** 65/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- **Skills & Technologies:** The project requires expertise in Databricks, Apache Spark, PySpark, Python, CI/CD for Databricks Deployment.
- **Experience:** The candidate has a substantial background in software architecture and performance tuning, and he is proficient in object-oriented programming and Python, but lacks explicit experience with Databricks specifically for deployments and Databricks Asset Bundle (DAB).
- **Relevant Experience:** Andreas Wittmann has extensive experience in IT consulting, architecture, and using cloud technologies, particularly AWS, but there is no explicit mention of Databricks, PySpark, or specific streaming architectures. However, he demonstrates adaptability and has worked with modern cloud solutions and Python, which are relevant to the project.
- **Certifications:** While the candidate holds several certifications, none show direct relevancy to Databricks or Apache Spark specifically.
- **Overall Assessment:** Andreas Wittmann possesses a strong background in cloud and software architecture which partially aligns with the requirements, but lacks specific experience with Databricks tools, which are crucial for the role.
