Working Remote: Client has stated that remote work is possible up to 90% of the whole project time. We think that the more a candidate is willing to work onsite the better it is. Especially in the beginning (first 3 weeks or so) of the project, the right candidate should commit him or herself to be regularly onsite. We think its definitely an advantage.

* Liquidity & Cash Management: Monitoring and managing daily liquidity; investing surplus funds.
* Banking & Payments: First point of contact for banks and group entities; support and ensure smooth payment processes.
* Financing & Risk Management: Support in monitoring FX risks as well as execution and settlement of hedging transactions.
* Reporting & Controlling: Preparation of treasury reports; monitoring of intra-group cash flows; support with compliance and audit requirements.
* Systems & Projects: Participation in the further development of the Treasury Management System as well as defined projects (e.g., Treasury Transformation, core banking implementations, account openings).
* Interfaces & Advisory: Collaboration with internal departments and subsidiaries; advice on treasury-related issues; support in integrations and acquisitions.
* Deputy Function: Independent responsibility for defined operational treasury tasks in case of substitution, including liquidity management, payments, and risk management

**Top 3 Must-Have Skills:**
1. Operational Treasury Expertise
* Hands-on experience in liquidity management, cash management, and payments
* Ability to take over critical processes independently from day one
2. System Competence (Treasury & ERP)
* Experience with Treasury Management Systems (ideally Coupa) and ERP (e.g., SAP)

## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-05T17:00:41.019889

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 10/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 10%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'monitoring', 'automation', 'enterprise', 'integration', 'compliance', 'beratung', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 30/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements (from project):
  - Operational treasury expertise: liquidity management, payments, FX trading, bank relationships (3‚Äì4 years hands-on)
  - Treasury project experience: TMS implementations, treasury transformation, M&A integrations (1‚Äì2 years)
  - System competence: Treasury Management Systems (ideally Coupa) and ERP (e.g., SAP); interfaces, workflows, automation
  - Communication & stakeholder management in German and English; willingness to be onsite initially

- CV vs. requirements (summary):
  - Operational treasury: CV shows no hands-on treasury, banking or FX trading experience ‚Üí strong mismatch
  - Treasury project experience: extensive IT migrations/transformations (Oracle, OSB, cloud, SAP infra) but no explicit TMS/Coupa or treasury functional projects ‚Üí partial/weak match
  - System competence & automation: CV shows strong technical skills (AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD, integrations, SAP BW/4HANA architecture) ‚Üí good technical fit for system implementation/integration work
  - Stakeholder & communication: long consulting background, German native and fluent English ‚Üí good fit
  - Ability to take over operational processes day one: CV does not demonstrate domain knowledge to run treasury operations independently ‚Üí mismatch

- Overall assessment / recommendation:
  - Andreas is a strong candidate for technical roles on TMS/ERP implementations, integrations, automation and AWS/cloud-based architectures, and would add value on the technical/DevOps side of a treasury transformation.
  - He is not a fit to perform core day-to-day treasury operations (liquidity management, payments execution, FX trading, bank relationship management) from day one. For that the client needs a candidate with finance/treasury operational experience.

- Fit rationale in one line: Excellent technical/integration skills and consulting experience but lacking the required hands-on treasury/finance domain experience, so low overall fit for an operational treasury lead role (score: 30/100).
