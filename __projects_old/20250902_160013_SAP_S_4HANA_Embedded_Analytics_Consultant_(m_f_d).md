## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-02T16:08:01.200166

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 15/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 15%. Found tags: ['ai', 'cloud', 'monitoring', 'architect', 'architecture', 'git', 'rest', 'sql', 'integration', 'agile', 'consultant', 'data', 'analytics', 'performance', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **Fit Score:** 35/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- **SAP S/4HANA Expertise**: The project requires specific experience with SAP S/4HANA, particularly in Embedded Analytics, which is not reflected in the CV. Andreas Wittmann has extensive experience in IT solutions but mostly in Java Enterprise, Cloud, Oracle, and Infrastructure domains rather than SAP S/4HANA.

- **ABAP and CDS Views**: The project demands expertise in ABAP CDS views and related technologies (SQL, AMDP Script). The CV does not list skills or projects related to ABAP or S/4HANA, making it a critical gap.

- **SAP Analytics Cloud & Fiori**: Experience with SAP Analytics Cloud and Fiori apps is required. The CV does not show any experience with these tools, indicating a mismatch.

- **Experience with SAP System Implementation/Migration**: There is no indication in the CV of hands-on experience with SAP system implementation or migration projects, which is a key requirement for the project.

- **HANA DB Monitoring and Performance Optimization**: The project values proficiency in HANA DB monitoring and optimization, a skill not listed in the CV.

- **Backend Development for SAP Applications**: While Wittmann has backend development experience, it aligns more with Java and AWS technologies than with SAP Fiori apps and similar S/4HANA-specific tools.

- **General IT/Cloud Expertise**: Wittmann's strengths in IT consultancy, cloud architecture, and AWS certifications are evident; however, these do not directly align with the specific SAP focus of the role.

Overall, there is a considerable gap between the SAP-specific qualifications and experiences required by the project and those presented in Wittmann's CV.
