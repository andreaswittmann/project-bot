## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-03T11:02:51.102134

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 13/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 13%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'rest', 'sql', 'integration', 'continuous', 'consultant', 'data', 'analytics', 'performance', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 15/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project:
  - ABAP development for S/4HANA Embedded Analytics (CDS views, AMDP/SQL/Script)
  - Backend for Fiori, Analysis for Office (Excel), SAC reporting / planning apps
  - Use of embedded BW inside S/4HANA and overall S/4HANA implementation/migration experience
  - Performance/monitoring on HANA DB and optimization of resource usage
  - Optional: Fiori transient query apps, knowledge of FI/CO, SD, P2P reporting
  - Remote/occasional onsite, fluent English

- Matches / positives from CV:
  - Strong cloud, architecture and migration experience (many AWS and migration projects)
  - Has a specific project designing SAP BW/4HANA Cloud infrastructure on AWS (2021) ‚Äî relevant at infra/architecture level
  - Broad experience with large enterprise systems, migrations and performance tuning
  - Fluent English, consultant/freelancer profile, available for remote engagements

- Gaps / risks versus requirements:
  - No evidence of ABAP, ABAP CDS view development, AMDP or ABAP-based backend work (core requirement)
  - No hands-on experience shown with Fiori app development, Analysis Office / Excel integration, SAC/Cognos development
  - Limited/no evidence of working with embedded BW inside S/4HANA or detailed HANA DB performance tuning
  - No explicit experience in S/4HANA functional modules (FI/CO, SD, P2P) or module-specific reporting

- Overall assessment (concise rationale):
  - The role is developer/analytics-focused (ABAP/CDS/Fiori/SAC). The CV is strong in cloud/infrastructure, migrations and enterprise middleware but lacks the core ABAP/embedded analytics skillset that is essential. The SAP BW/4HANA infrastructure design experience is a plus but not a substitute for hands-on ABAP/Embedded Analytics work. Therefore the candidate is a low fit for this specific position.

- Scoring rationale: 0/70 for missing core ABAP/Embedded-Analytics developer skills; ~15/30 for relevant architecture/cloud/SAP infra experience => final score 15/100.

- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI

- **Fit Score:** 15/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project:
  - ABAP development for S/4HANA Embedded Analytics (ABAP CDS views, AMDP/SQL/Script)
  - Backend for Fiori, Analysis for Office (Excel), SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) reporting & planning
  - Use of embedded BW in an S/4HANA system
  - Hands-on experience in complex S/4HANA implementation or migration projects
  - HANA DB performance/monitoring and optimization (nice-to-have)
  - Fiori transient query apps and S/4HANA module reporting (FI/CO, SD, P2P) (nice-to-have)

- Matches / positives in the CV:
  - Strong enterprise architecture, migration and performance-tuning experience across many large projects
  - Explicit project designing SAP BW/4HANA Cloud infrastructure on AWS (2021) ‚Äî relevant at infra/architecture level
  - Extensive cloud (AWS), IaC (Terraform), container/Kubernetes and DevOps skills that help in S/4HANA cloud/infra contexts
  - Long consulting experience, fluent English, remote-capable and proven delivery in enterprise environments

- Major gaps vs. core requirements:
  - No evidence of ABAP development, ABAP CDS view authoring, AMDP scripting or related ABAP backend work (core requirement)
  - No hands‚Äëon experience shown for Fiori app development, Analysis Office Excel integration, SAC reporting/planning apps
  - No demonstrated use of embedded BW inside S/4HANA or HANA DB performance tuning/monitoring experience
  - No explicit experience in S/4HANA functional modules (FI/CO, SD, P2P) or module-specific reporting

- Assessment / recommendation:
  - The role is developer- and analytics-focused (ABAP/CDS/Fiori/SAC). The candidate is strong at infrastructure, cloud and migration architecture (including an SAP BW/4HANA infrastructure design), but lacks the mandatory hands-on ABAP/Embedded Analytics skillset required to perform the day-to-day tasks in this role.
  - Fit judgement: low. Candidate could be considered only for an adjacent architecture/infrastructure advisory role on S/4HANA/BW projects, not as the Embedded Analytics ABAP developer/implementer the project asks for.

- Fit score rationale (summary):
  - +15 points for relevant SAP infra/BW architecture, migrations, cloud and performance experience
  - 0 points for core required competencies (ABAP, CDS, AMDP, Fiori, SAC, embedded BW) because they are not evidenced
  - Final fit score: 15/100
