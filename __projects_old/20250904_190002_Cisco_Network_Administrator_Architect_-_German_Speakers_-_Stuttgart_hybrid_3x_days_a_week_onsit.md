### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 10/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 10%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'architect', 'enterprise', 'security', 'compliance', 'performance', 'remote', 'hybrid', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 25/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the offer:
  - Strong hands‚Äëon experience with Cisco campus networking (LAN/WLAN)
  - Experience with Cisco ISE, Cisco Prime, DNAC, and Meraki
  - Proven network rollout, migration and troubleshooting in large enterprise environments
  - Cisco certification (CCNP or higher)
  - Fluent German and business English; onsite in Stuttgart 3x/week; ITIL/BSI familiarity advantageous

- Match against the CV (Andreas Wittmann):
  - Good matches:
    - Extensive enterprise architecture and operations experience; proven track record in large enterprise projects and migrations
    - Strong documentation, design and troubleshooting discipline; history of delivering multi‚Äëstage rollouts and migrations
    - Security experience (SSL, SAML, WS‚ÄëSecurity, AD integration) and familiarity with compliance/security processes
    - Fluent German and business English; long freelance/consulting experience (appropriate contract type)
  - Partial matches / transferable skills:
    - Network‚Äëadjacent cloud networking expertise (AWS VPC, Transit Gateway, networking services) and infrastructure automation (Terraform, IaC)
    - Experience with monitoring/management tooling (Prometheus, Grafana knowledge) and DevOps/automation practices useful for platform management
  - Gaps / mismatches:
    - No explicit Cisco hands‚Äëon experience listed (ISE, Prime, DNAC, Meraki absent)
    - No Cisco certifications (CCNP/CCIE) shown
    - No explicit WLAN/campus LAN administration background or proof of wireless troubleshooting expertise
    - Location: CV lists Hamburg ‚Äî role requires being based in/working onsite in Stuttgart 3 days/week (no indication of willingness to relocate/commute)
    - No explicit mention of ITIL or BSI standard experience (only general security/architecture work)

- Concise assessment / rationale:
  - Andreas brings strong enterprise architecture, migration and security skills that are valuable for complex infrastructure projects, plus cloud networking and automation expertise. However, the role is highly Cisco‚Äëcentric (ISE, Prime, DNAC, Meraki, WLAN/campus LAN) and requires Cisco certification and hands‚Äëon experience that are not evidenced in the CV. The onsite requirement in Stuttgart is another practical constraint. These gaps reduce the immediate fit for this specific Cisco Network Administrator/Architect assignment.

- Recommendation: Candidate could be considered if the client accepts a cloud/network architect with strong automation/security skills and is willing to pair him with a Cisco‚Äëspecialist for product‚Äëspecific tasks, or if Andreas can demonstrate recent hands‚Äëon Cisco experience or obtain a Cisco certification quickly.
