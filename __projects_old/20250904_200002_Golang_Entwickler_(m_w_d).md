## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-04T20:00:39.412988

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 27/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 27%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'kubernetes', 'container', 'argo', 'devops', 'ci/cd', 'pipeline', 'jenkins', 'gitlab', 'automation', 'iac', 'python', 'git', 'api', 'rest', 'integration', 'security', 'agile', 'continuous', 'deployment', 'consultant', 'beratung', 'consulting', 'scalability', 'performance', 'load balancing', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 60/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements:
  - Go development (min 3 years) and willingness to use Go exclusively for core components
  - Building RESTful services in distributed, multi-tenant environments
  - System programming (low-level interactions, memory management, performance optimization)
  - CI/CD & gitOps (GitLab, Jenkins, Tekton, Argo Workflows/Argo CD); creation and maintenance of pipelines
  - Containerization and Kubernetes (packaging, customizing deployments)
  - Experience with hyperscalers (GCP and others) and multi-cloud
  - Automated unit/integration testing and test frameworks
  - Networking (protocols, load balancing) and security
  - Agile/DevOps methodologies and strong English (C1)

- Match vs CV (Andreas Wittmann):
  - Go: NO explicit Go experience shown. CV lists Python, Java, C++ (historical), but no proven Go projects ‚Äî major gap for a role that requires exclusive Go usage.
  - RESTful services: YES ‚Äî many projects include SOAP/REST integrations and API work.
  - System programming: PARTIAL ‚Äî early-career C++/CORBA and extensive middleware work, but limited evidence of recent low-level memory-management work expected for system programming in Go/C++.
  - CI/CD & gitOps: YES ‚Äî hands-on with GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, Argo CD, AWS CodePipeline, Terraform/IaC; strong DevOps background.
  - Kubernetes & containerization: YES ‚Äî KCNA certified, experience with k3s, EKS, Minikube, Docker, Helm, Argo CD.
  - Hyperscalers: STRONG AWS expertise (many projects & certs); limited explicit GCP experience (mentions multi-cloud in some projects but no GCP projects called out).
  - Testing & automation: YES ‚Äî automated functional and integration tests, CI pipelines, test automation experience documented.
  - Networking/load balancing/security: YES ‚Äî SSL, SAML/SSO, WS-Security, ELB, VPC, Transit Gateway and general AWS networking and security experience.
  - Agile/DevOps & English: YES ‚Äî agile methodologies used across projects; English fluent.

- Concise assessment:
  - Strengths: deep cloud architecture and DevOps skills, solid Kubernetes/CI/CD and testing experience, strong AWS and middleware background, documentation and consulting experience.
  - Main risk: no demonstrated Go experience (the client requires exclusive use of Go for core components). Secondary risk: limited explicit GCP experience and limited recent evidence of low-level system programming in C/C++.
  - Fit recommendation: Good technical fit for cloud/DevOps/architect responsibilities and many non-language requirements. If the client can accept rapid upskilling into Go (mentor/on-the-job), candidate is a viable choice; if the client requires proven, senior Go expertise from day one, this candidate is a risky match.
