## 🤖 AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-05T19:00:54.875511

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 11/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ✅ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 11%. Found tags: ['aws', 'amazon', 'ai', 'ki', 'cloud', 'rest', 'sql', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 20/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the offer:
  - PHP (>= 5 years), PHP8
  - Mastery of Symfony or Laravel
  - MySQL
  - Excellent knowledge of Redis
  - Proven testing best practices (CI/CD, automated tests)
  - Good knowledge of Cloud Platforms (ideally AWS)
  - Fluent English

- Match vs CV (Andreas Wittmann):
  - PHP / PHP8: No evidence of PHP experience in the CV (main languages: Java, Python, Jython, Perl, Bash). Major gap.
  - Symfony / Laravel: Not mentioned. Major gap for framework requirement.
  - MySQL: Not explicitly mentioned; CV shows broad RDBMS experience (Oracle, Aurora, RDS) but not MySQL. Partial/uncertain.
  - Redis: Not mentioned (has experience with Prometheus/Grafana, Salt/Ansible, Terraform, but no Redis). Gap.
  - Testing / CI-CD / DevOps: Strong — multiple projects with GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, automated tests, IaC, Terraform, live-scripting, Saltstack.
  - AWS / Cloud: Very strong — many AWS projects and multiple AWS certifications (including Solutions Architect Professional) and Landing Zone experience.
  - English: Fluent (CV states English fluent).

- Concise assessment:
  - Strengths relevant to the role: excellent AWS/cloud architecture, DevOps, testing/CI-CD practices and automation.
  - Critical gaps: no demonstrable PHP, no Laravel/Symfony, no Redis, no explicit MySQL experience — these are core to the advertised hands-on PHP developer role.
  - Practical conclusion: Candidate is a strong cloud/DevOps/architecture fit but lacks the essential hands-on PHP framework and Redis skills required for immediate contribution as a PHP Software Engineer for this client.

- Scoring rationale (weighted):
  - Core PHP & frameworks (Laravel/Symfony): 60% weight -> 0/60
  - Redis: 10% weight -> 0/10
  - MySQL: 10% weight -> 3/10 (partial RDBMS experience but no explicit MySQL)
  - AWS / Cloud: 15% weight -> 15/15
  - Testing / CI-CD / DevOps practices: 5% weight -> 2/5

  Total = 0 + 0 + 3 + 15 + 2 = 20/100

- Recommendation: Not recommended for an immediate hands-on PHP backend role. Consider for AWS/DevOps/architecture consultancy or if the client is open to retraining/mentoring on PHP frameworks and Redis.
