## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-10T19:02:53.013261

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 15/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 15%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'architect', 'architekt', 'architecture', 'architektur', 'automation', 'integration', 'compliance', 'lean', 'consultant', 'beratung', 'data', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 90/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚úÖ ACCEPTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project offer:
  - Establish a Design Authority Board and ensure compliance with architectural principles and IT standards
  - Design & implement a lean Governance Assessment integrated into the software lifecycle, ideally leveraging AI for automation
  - Review/refine architectural principles, IT standards, risk management, data governance, third-party management and business capability alignment
  - University degree in CS/related, 7+ years (Senior) or 4+ years (Mid) experience
  - Strong stakeholder management, communication, analytical thinking; fluent German & English

- Strong matches in the CV:
  - Education & experience: Diplom-Informatiker + ~30 years of IT (well above Senior threshold)
  - Architecture & governance-relevant work: multiple enterprise architecture, Landing Zone and multi-account AWS designs, Control Tower/AWS Organizations, SAP-on-AWS reference architecture (shows governance & platform thinking)
  - Automation & lifecycle integration: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation), GitLab CI/CD/GitHub Copilot workflows, Live-scripting, automated patch & deployment processes ‚Äî demonstrates ability to integrate governance into the software lifecycle
  - AI & automation capability: recent projects (LibreChat, private AI, AWS Bedrock), AWS Certified AI Practitioner and GitHub Copilot cert ‚Äî relevant for AI-enabled governance automation
  - Data/platform exposure: SAP BW/4HANA design on AWS, broad AWS service knowledge (data services listed), familiarity with observability tools (Prometheus/Grafana) ‚Äî useful for data governance and platform alignment
  - Stakeholder & advisory experience: long consulting background, workshops, pre-sales, cross-organisational projects ‚Äî strong stakeholder management and communication skills
  - Languages: German native, English fluent

- Gaps / potential risks:
  - No explicit TOGAF/COBIT or formal IT governance framework certification mentioned (but practical governance work evident)
  - Explicit ‚Äúthird-party management‚Äù and formal data governance frameworks are not strongly documented (experience suggests plausible capability, but not documented as such)
  - No explicit mention of having set up a formal Design Authority Board (though CV contains many governance/standards and architecture-lead activities that imply capability)

- Assessment summary / justification for score (90/100):
  - The candidate ticks virtually all core boxes: required education, senior-level experience, broad architecture and cloud governance experience, strong automation/IaC skills, demonstrable AI-project work and certifications, and excellent stakeholder/consulting background.
  - Small deduction for missing explicit certifications in formal governance frameworks (TOGAF/COBIT) and only implicit evidence for some specific items (formal Design Authority setup, named data-governance programs). These are minor because the CV shows strong practical experience designing standards, landing zones and automated lifecycle controls that map directly to the project needs.

## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-16T09:38:24.030363

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 100/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Pre-evaluation bypassed (forced evaluation mode)

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 70/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements:
  - Establish Design Authority Board; enforce architectural principles and IT standards
  - Design & implement a lean Governance Assessment integrated into the software lifecycle (preferably AI-enabled)
  - Review/refine architectural principles, IT standards, risk management, data governance, third-party management, business capability alignment
  - University degree; 4‚Äì7+ years experience (Mid/Senior); fluent German & English; strong stakeholder management

- How the CV matches (strengths):
  - Education & experience: Diplom-Informatiker + ~30 years consulting/architecture experience (well above Senior requirement)
  - Architecture & governance experience: multiple enterprise-architecture projects (AWS Landing Zone/Control Tower, SAP-on-AWS reference architecture, multi-account designs) and long history of designing operational standards and platform architectures
  - Automation & lifecycle integration: strong IaC and automation skills (Terraform, CloudFormation, SaltStack, GitLab CI/CD, live-scripting, automated patch/deploy workflows) ‚Äî directly relevant to embedding governance in the SDLC
  - AI & automation capability: recent projects (LibreChat/private AI, Project Bot) and AWS AI practitioner & GitHub Copilot certifications ‚Äî relevant for AI-enabled governance/automation
  - Stakeholder & consulting skills: decades of advisory work, workshops, pre-sales, cross-organizational projects; native German and fluent English

- Gaps / risks (items reducing fit):
  - No explicit record of having set up a formal "Design Authority Board" (experience implies capability, but not explicitly documented)
  - No formal governance framework certifications listed (e.g., TOGAF, COBIT) ‚Äî mitigated by strong practical governance work but still a credential gap
  - Third-party management and structured data-governance programs are not strongly documented (some data/platform work exists, but limited explicit evidence)
  - Logistics: Project is based in Zurich/Switzerland and appears to require on-site presence; CV lists Hamburg and does not state Swiss availability ‚Äî this is a potential hard constraint and could be a dealbreaker if strict on-site presence is required

- Overall assessment / reasoning for score (70/100):
  - Technical and experiential fit is high: candidate covers almost all technical and advisory requirements and brings strong AI + automation credentials (baseline ~90).
  - Small deductions for missing explicit formal governance certifications and not documenting a direct Design Authority Board setup (~ -10).
  - Larger operational deduction for on-site Switzerland requirement (potential availability/location blocker) (~ -10).
  - Final score reflects a strong technical match but a material logistical / documentation gap that should be validated before proceeding.

- Recommendation: Validate candidate willingness/ability to work on-site in Switzerland and probe for concrete examples of having established or chaired cross-functional governance bodies. If on-site logistics can be resolved, this is a strong match.
