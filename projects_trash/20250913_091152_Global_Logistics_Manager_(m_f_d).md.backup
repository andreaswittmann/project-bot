## ü§ñ AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-16T09:35:05.266116

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 100/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Passed
- **Rationale:** Pre-evaluation bypassed (forced evaluation mode)

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 12/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements (extracted):
  - Supply chain / logistics experience in the pharmaceutical industry
  - Knowledge of SAP MM/SD transactions
  - Manage international distribution, logistics and trade operations (order-to-cash, stock/transfers)
  - Performance monitoring, optimization of transportation/logistics, leading improvement projects
  - Excellent English (verbal/written), Bachelor degree or APICS (nice-to-have)
  - Data-driven mindset; freelance availability for ~16+ months

- Matches in the CV:
  - Strong consulting/architect background and experience leading technical projects and cross-functional teams
  - Several engagements with international logistics clients (architecture, migration, operations support) ‚Äî familiarity with that sector from an IT/operations perspective
  - Experience with monitoring and performance analysis (mentions Prometheus/Grafana familiarity, many performance/availability projects)
  - Fluent English and a technical university degree; long freelance/consulting history and availability as an IT contractor
  - Strong automation/DevOps/cloud skills (AWS, Terraform, CI/CD) and data/monitoring tool knowledge which support data-driven improvements

- Major gaps vs. the role:
  - No explicit pharmaceutical industry experience (no pharma domain projects listed)
  - No explicit SAP MM/SD functional experience or transactions knowledge (SAP not present in CV)
  - No demonstrated hands-on supply chain / logistics operations experience (order-to-cash, inventory management, trade compliance) ‚Äî CV is IT/architecture-focused rather than operational logistics
  - APICS / supply chain certifications not present
  - Role is a business/process-heavy Logistics Manager position; the CV is strongly technical/architectural ‚Äî potential mismatch in day-to-day responsibilities

- Assessment rationale and score reasoning:
  - This role is primarily a domain/functional logistics manager (pharma + SAP MM/SD + operational supply chain) rather than a technical/cloud/DevOps role. Andreas has strong transferable consulting, stakeholder management, monitoring and automation skills and some exposure to logistics clients, but lacks core domain experience (pharma) and the required SAP MM/SD functional knowledge. Given the critical nature of domain + SAP skills for this position, the candidate is a low fit for this specific role despite many transferable strengths.

- Bottom line: low fit for a Global Logistics Manager in pharma with SAP MM/SD focus (score: 12/100).
