### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 10/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ✅ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 10%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'llm', 'container', 'integration', 'consultant', 'remote', 'hybrid', 'freelance', 'projekt', 'project', 'ant']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **Fit Score:** 18/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements:
  - Senior technical project lead for containerized product solutions (customer projects, design orders, sales, NPI/NTI).
  - >10 years domain experience (preferably reciprocating engines and/or containerized product solution industries).
  - Substantial product-development experience for containerized solutions and strong system-integration skills.
  - Project management, cross-functional coordination (Sales, Sourcing, Engineering, Service, PMO, PLM) and supplier evaluation/RFQ support.
  - Strong leadership, communication in English, willingness to travel (≈30%, USA travel a plus).

- Relevant matches in the CV:
  - Very senior (≈30 years) technical experience and long track record as consultant/architect and company founder — meets seniority and leadership expectations.
  - Strong program/project management experience: running large, multi-environment IT projects, stakeholder coordination, milestone tracking and reviews.
  - Proven system-integration experience (complex integrations across subsystems) and supplier/customer interaction in IT projects.
  - Fluent English; willing/able to travel (many on-site historical projects).

- Major mismatches / risks:
  - No evidence of mechanical engineering experience, reciprocating engines, HVAC or physical container product development (the job is engineering/container solutions in machine/plant context).
  - No demonstrated experience with CAD, mechanical design, manufacturing processes, packaging or supplier RFQ for physical components — core to the role.
  - “Container” in the CV refers to software containers (Docker/Kubernetes) not physical containerized product solutions; this is a likely semantic mismatch.
  - No explicit references to relevant industry standards, safety/regulatory knowledge or hands-on hardware/system testing applicable to reciprocating engine containers.

- Overall assessment / recommendation:
  - The candidate has strong transferable leadership, project- and systems-integration skills and would excel in complex cross-functional technical programs — but primarily in IT/cloud/software domains.
  - For a role requiring deep mechanical/container product development experience (reciprocating engines / physical container solutions) the CV shows insufficient domain-specific expertise.
  - Fit score reflects strong senior program skills but major domain mismatch; candidate could be considered only if the client accepts a systems-integration/IT-facing lead rather than a mechanical/product-engineering lead.

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **Fit Score:** 20/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements:
  - Senior technical project lead for physical/containerized product solutions (reciprocating gas engines).
  - >10 years domain experience in reciprocating engines and/or containerized product solution industries.
  - Product development of physical container solutions, system integration, supplier RFQ/support, CAD/manufacturing/testing knowledge.
  - Cross-functional program management, stakeholder coordination, travel (~30%), English proficiency.

- Strong matches from CV:
  - Very senior technical leader (~30 years) with proven project/program management and cross-functional coordination.
  - Clear experience owning milestones, running complex technical projects, stakeholder management and documentation.
  - Travel/on-site history and fluent English.
  - Skilled in systems-integration, supplier/customer interactions in IT projects — strong transferable leadership skills.
  - Recent experience with software containers (Docker, Kubernetes), cloud (AWS), IaC (Terraform) — modern tooling for software/container orchestration.

- Major gaps / mismatches:
  - No evidence of mechanical engineering, reciprocating engines, HVAC or physical container/product design and development.
  - No CAD, manufacturing process, testing/qualification of hardware, compliance/regulatory or physical supplier RFQ experience for mechanical components.
  - The CV’s "container" expertise refers to software containers (Docker/K8s), not physical containerized product solutions — likely semantic mismatch.

- Conclusion / recommendation:
  - Candidate is a strong senior technical program lead for IT/software/integration domains and could support digital/control/DevOps aspects of containerized products.
  - For a mechanical/product-engineering lead role (reciprocating engines / physical container solutions) the domain-specific gaps are critical; not a good fit unless the client accepts an IT/system-integration–focused lead rather than a hardware/product-engineering lead.
