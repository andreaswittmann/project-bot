## 🤖 AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-08-30T16:47:23.310063

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 11/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ✅ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 11%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'llm', 'architect', 'automation', 'python', 'shell', 'scripting', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **Fit Score:** 30/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the project offer:
  - Expert knowledge of Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) including installation/configuration of Scheduling Master and agents, administration, version/scheduler migration, and DR activities.
  - Experience migrating from Microsoft Orchestrator to TWS (or equivalent migration experience between schedulers).
  - Creating, managing and executing batch/job flows; integrating 3rd-party software into the scheduler; maintaining schedules and escalation handling for production batch issues.
  - Scripting experience (PowerShell, Python, VB, DOS) and hands-on experience on Windows environments.
  - Strong German written/verbal communication; 6+ years experience; ability to work standalone and own incidents.

- Comparison vs. CV (Andreas Wittmann):
  - Direct matches: ~30 years IT experience, native German, strong automation/DevOps background, extensive experience with migrations, high-availability architectures, CI/CD and operational runbooks. Repeated experience building automated provisioning, patching and batch frameworks. Solid scripting skills shown (Python, bash, Perl, Jython) and historical Windows Server exposure. Demonstrated incident/problem resolution and production support.
  - Partial matches: Experience with general job/batch concepts and building a J2EE batch framework (2004–2005) and many DevOps automation activities (SaltStack, GitLab CI/CD, Terraform/IaC) — transferable knowledge for schedulers.
  - Missing or weak: No mention of Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) or IBM Workload Automation products, no explicit experience migrating from MS Orchestrator to TWS, no explicit PowerShell or VB scripting examples (PowerShell only implied by Windows admin history), and no concrete evidence of hands-on Level 2/3 TWS administration in distributed environments.

- Assessment / concise rationale:
  - The candidate brings strong automation, migration, and batch-processing domain knowledge plus relevant scripting and Windows experience — useful and partially transferable to a scheduler role.
  - However, the role requires explicit, hands-on Tivoli/TWS expertise and MS Orchestrator->TWS migration experience which the CV does not show. That gap is material for a Level 2.5/3 TWS architect/administrator position.
  - If the client is willing to accept a strong automation/cloud architect who can ramp up on TWS quickly, the candidate could be considered; if the client needs immediate, experienced TWS administrators with documented TWS migrations, this CV is not a fit.

- Recommendation: fit_score 30/100 (partial fit due to transferable automation and batch experience but lacks direct Tivoli/TWS and Orchestrator migration experience).

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 11/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ✅ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 11%. Found tags: ['ai', 'ki', 'llm', 'architect', 'automation', 'python', 'shell', 'scripting', 'remote', 'freelance', 'projekt']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **Fit Score:** 28/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements from the offer:
  - Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) architecture/administration (Level 2.5/3): install/configure masters & agents, create/manage/execute batch flows, integrate 3rd-party tools, scheduler migrations
  - Migration experience specifically from MS Orchestrator to TWS
  - Troubleshooting/incident management, DR for batch
  - Scripting: PowerShell, Python, VB, DOS (Windows focus)
  - 6+ years experience, strong German written/verbal communication, ability to work independently

- Matches / strengths in the CV:
  - 30 years IT experience, German native, proven ability to work as independent consultant and lead migration projects
  - Strong background in batch/automation, CI/CD, Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform), deployments and creating repeatable automated processes
  - Hands-on experience with installing and configuring complex environments, HA/DR design, migrations (many Oracle/OSB/WebLogic and cloud migrations), troubleshooting production issues and patching
  - Scripting and automation experience: Python, bash, SaltStack, Ansible (basic), GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins — transferable to scheduler automation
  - Experience with other job/batch-related work (historic batch framework, automations for deployments and job pipelines)

- Gaps vs. the job ask:
  - No explicit Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) or IBM Tivoli product experience mentioned
  - No mention of migration from MS Orchestrator to TWS (specific migration path requested)
  - Little to no explicit experience with Windows-centric scripting languages requested (PowerShell, VB, DOS); CV shows more Unix/Linux tooling and bash/Python
  - The role requests 100% remote/freelance immediate start and deep TWS L2/L3 expertise — CV demonstrates strong adjacent automation/cloud skills but not the core product expertise

- Overall assessment and recommendation:
  - Candidate is senior, experienced in automation, migrations, DR and troubleshooting and speaks German — technically capable of learning a new scheduler quickly.
  - However, for an immediate need requiring hands-on TWS L2/L3 and a MS Orchestrator->TWS migration, the lack of explicit Tivoli/TWS and Windows PowerShell experience is a major mismatch.

- Fit conclusion: 28/100 — transferable automation and migration strengths present, but missing the critical product-specific (TWS) and MS Orchestrator migration experience requested by the client.
