# Dashboard Score Update Fix Plan

## Problem Analysis
When re-evaluation is triggered, the project gets new evaluation entries appended to the markdown file, but the dashboard continues to display old scores because the API parsing logic only extracts the first evaluation match instead of the latest one.

## Root Cause
The `parse_project_file` function in `server_enhanced.py` uses `re.search()` which finds the first regex match, but with multiple evaluations, we need the most recent one.

## Solution Overview
Modify the score extraction logic to find all evaluation sections and use the latest scores.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Update Score Parsing Logic
- Modify `parse_project_file` function in `server_enhanced.py`
- Change from `re.search()` to `re.findall()` to get all matches
- Extract timestamps and scores from all evaluation sections
- Select the most recent evaluation based on timestamp

### 2. Handle Multiple Evaluation Sections
- Parse all "## ðŸ¤– AI Evaluation Results" sections
- Extract evaluation timestamp, pre-eval score, and LLM fit score from each
- Compare timestamps to find the latest evaluation
- Use the latest scores for dashboard display

### 3. Ensure Dashboard Refresh
- Verify that after reevaluation, the store properly refreshes data
- Confirm that `fetchProjects()` and `fetchStats()` are called after reevaluation
- Test the complete flow: reevaluate â†’ parse latest scores â†’ update dashboard

### 4. Testing
- Test with projects that have multiple evaluations
- Verify dashboard shows latest scores after reevaluation
- Check that filtering and sorting work with updated scores

## Expected Outcome
- Dashboard will display the most recent evaluation scores âœ…
- Re-evaluation will immediately update the dashboard âœ…
- No manual refresh required after reevaluation âœ…
- Backward compatibility maintained for projects with single evaluations âœ…

## Implementation Notes
- Keep existing regex patterns for backward compatibility âœ…
- Add timestamp parsing to determine evaluation recency âœ…
- Handle cases where timestamps might be missing âœ…
- Maintain performance for large numbers of projects âœ…

## Implementation Status
âœ… **COMPLETED**: Modified `parse_project_file` function in `server_enhanced.py`
- Added `extract_latest_scores()` function that finds all evaluation sections
- Extracts timestamps and scores from each evaluation
- Returns the most recent evaluation based on timestamp
- Tested with real project file containing multiple evaluations
- Backward compatibility maintained for single-evaluation projects
- Syntax validation passed
- Test verification successful

## Testing Results
- âœ… Test PASSED: Correct latest scores extracted from multi-evaluation project
- Latest Pre-evaluation Score: 28 (from second evaluation)
- Latest LLM Score: 68 (from second evaluation)
