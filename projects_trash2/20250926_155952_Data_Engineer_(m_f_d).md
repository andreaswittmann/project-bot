## 🤖 AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-26T16:06:24.972280

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 12/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ✅ Passed
- **Rationale:** Score: 12%. Found tags: ['aws', 'ai', 'ki', 'llm', 'ml', 'pipeline', 'python', 'git', 'data', 'performance', 'remote', 'freelance']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 70/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key project requirements:
  - Refactor and build high-quality datasets; design/implement data models for interactive dashboards (Cube.js)
  - Strong experience with: Python, dbt, git, Apache Airflow, AWS Athena, QuickSight, Cube.js
  - Optimize data models/pipelines for performance, reliability, cost
  - Cross-functional teamwork (product managers, data analysts, data scientists, engineers)
  - Bonus: use of LLMs for text classification/metadata enrichment/auto-labeling

- Match with CV (strengths):
  - Python: repeated use across many projects — strong practical experience
  - git / CI tooling: extensive experience (Git, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub, Jenkins, SVN)
  - AWS: deep, certified AWS expertise (Solutions Architect Pro, broad hands-on familiarity with many AWS services including Athena and QuickSight in his AWS training list)
  - Data architecture & migration experience: proven track record (SAP BW/4HANA architecture on AWS, migrations, designing Landing Zones, dataset/system migrations) — demonstrates ability to design and optimize data solutions
  - Cross-functional and consulting experience: long history of stakeholder collaboration and consulting at enterprise level
  - LLMs / generative AI: recent, hands‑on projects (Project Bot, LibreChat, AWS Bedrock integrations) — strong bonus for the LLM requirement
  - Remote / freelance experience and English fluency: matches the role

- Gaps / risks:
  - No explicit mention of dbt experience (data transformation framework) — likely a gap that would require ramp-up or substitution with generic SQL/ETL skills
  - No explicit Apache Airflow experience documented (Project Bot uses APScheduler; CI/CD automation experience exists but not Airflow)
  - No evidence of Cube.js experience (dashboarding requirement uses Cube.js specifically)
  - While AWS training lists many data services, some items appear in a training/certification context rather than clear long-term production usage for each service (verify Athena/QuickSight depth)

- Overall assessment & recommendation:
  - Strong cloud architecture, Python and AWS fundamentals; excellent fit for architecture-led data engineering and projects that require cloud design, LLM integration and stakeholder handling.
  - Operational gaps: dbt, Airflow and Cube.js are specific tactical tools the role requires — these can be learned quickly by an experienced architect, but would be ramp-up items.
  - Recommendation: interview to validate practical Athena/QuickSight usage, willingness/availability to pick up dbt/Airflow/Cube.js quickly, and to discuss examples of dataset refactoring and pipeline optimization.

(Score rationale: strong match on core cloud, Python and LLM capabilities + consulting fit, minus points for missing critical tactical tools => fit score 70/100.)
