## 🤖 AI Evaluation Results

**Evaluation Timestamp:** 2025-09-26T20:13:31.625406

### Pre-Evaluation Phase
- **Score:** 100/100
- **Threshold:** 10/100
- **Result:** ✅ Passed
- **Rationale:** Pre-evaluation bypassed (forced evaluation mode)

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 70/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ❌ REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements extracted from the project offer:
  - No concrete technical requirements provided (description: "Please provide a detailed project description here").
  - Metadata: unspecified start date, unspecified contract/type, unspecified on-site vs. remote (shows "% Remote"), client = anwi.

- Interpretation / implied needs (because offer is empty):
  - Project could be a general IT/cloud/DevOps/architecture engagement or a small/medium enterprise consulting engagement.
  - Remote-capable work is expected or at least possible.

- Match summary (CV -> likely needs):
  - Strong match on cloud architecture and operations: multiple AWS certifications (Solutions Architect Professional, Associate, SysOps, Developer, Cloud Practitioner), extensive AWS service experience, Landing Zone and multi-account designs, SAP on AWS design.
  - IaC / automation: Terraform certified (HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate), practical Terraform scripting, CloudFormation exposure, SaltStack, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, GitHub, CI/CD experience.
  - Container / orchestration / platform: KCNA (Kubernetes), EKS, Docker, Helm, ArgoCD, Prometheus/Grafana familiarity.
  - DevOps / SRE skills: automation, monitoring, patching strategies, high-availability design, infrastructure as code, IaC testing, automated deployment pipelines.
  - Integration / middleware / enterprise systems: deep experience with Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Service Bus, Oracle Forms & Reports, large migrations—valuable for enterprise modernization projects.
  - Software development / full-stack and AI: Python, Flask, Vue.js, JS, Java (long history), modern AI/agent projects (Project Bot, LibreChat, AWS Bedrock), GitHub Copilot usage—fits roles involving generative AI integration or prototyping.
  - Security & compliance: SSL, SAML, WS-Security, AD integration, secure deployment practices, and experience advising on data protection for AI deployments.
  - Additional strengths: trainer/consultant experience, documentation practice (live-scripting), architect-level advisory and hands-on delivery.

- Gaps / uncertainties:
  - Project-specific skills are unknown; if the role requires niche tech not in the CV (e.g., .NET Core, specific proprietary stacks, certain frontend frameworks beyond Vue.js), fit may be lower.
  - Availability, hourly/day rate, contract type and exact remote/on-site split are not provided.
  - Recent hands-on depth for some very new technologies (depending on the client's exact needs) may require validation (e.g., production-grade deployment experience with a specific vendor model or a particular cloud-native tool not listed).

- Recommendation / conclusion:
  - The candidate is a strong, senior-level match for a broad set of cloud architecture, DevOps, migration, middleware modernization, and AI-integration projects. Given the absence of concrete project requirements, there is high potential but low specificity. Hence a fit score of 70/100: high suitability for many likely scenarios, but reduced confidence because the offer lacks detail. Next step: request the detailed project description (required skills, technologies, responsibilities, contract type, start date, remote/on-site expectations) to increase the score and refine the match.
