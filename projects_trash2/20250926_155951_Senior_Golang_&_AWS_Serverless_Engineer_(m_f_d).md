## Beschreibung
We are looking for a **true Go/AWS Serverless expert** to support an ambitious cloud-native platform project for our client **a client from the premium automotive sector** . This is not a generic backend role ‚Äì we are searching for an engineer with strong skills in **idiomatic Go** , solid **serverless AWS experience** , and a passion for simplicity, automation, and clean architecture. If you enjoy building developer tools, taming legacy Go code with clean refactoring, and shaping internal services that may eventually become open source ‚Äì this is your opportunity. 
 **What we‚Äôre looking for:** - Backend engineer with a strong focus on**Golang**(Go is the team's preferred language)
- **Idiomatic Go**‚Äì not Java-style Go code
- **Deep AWS Serverless knowledge**, especially:
- Lambda
- Step Functions
- DynamoDB (Single Table Design, Queries, Composite Keys)
- API Gateway
- Good architectural judgment: knowing when to use Lambda, EC2, or other AWS services
- **Testing mindset**:
- Unit Tests, Table-Driven Tests, Integration Tests
- Tests are treated as part of documentation and essential to code quality
- Clean Code advocate; open to refactoring legacy Go code
- Comfortable with Unix/Linux and has a builder‚Äôs mindset
- Enjoys working on**developer tools**and**internal platform services**
 
 **Tech Stack:** - **Go**(microservices, operators, tooling)
- **AWS**: Lambda, Step Functions, DynamoDB, some EC2
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- GitHub, GitLab, CI/CD, infrastructure testing
 
 **Must-Have Skills:** - Golang (idiomatic usage, clean code, testing)
- AWS Serverless: Lambda, DynamoDB, Step Functions, API Gateway
- Deep understanding of serverless design and trade-offs
- CDK in Go, Git-based workflows
 
 **Nice-to-Have Skills:** - Bash scripting, OAuth2
- Networking fundamentals
- Observability: OpenTelemetry, AWS X-Ray
 
 **Project Details:** - **Start:**01.01.2026
- **Location:**100% Remote (nearshore welcome ‚Äì within ¬±2 hours of CET/CEST)
- **Capacity:**Full-time (100%)
- **Contract Type:**Freelance or via service provider
 We are not looking for: Java-style developers or those who write Go like Java Container specialists (Kubernetes, etc.) ‚Äì **this is a serverless-first team** 
 **Interested?** We look forward to receiving your CV, references, and hourly rate. We‚Äôre happy to answer any questions about the position and the client.

### Pre-Evaluation Phase

Found tags: ['aws', 'ai', 'ki', 'ml', 'cloud', 'kubernetes', 'container', 'architect', 'architecture', 'devops', 'ci/cd', 'gitlab', 'automation', 'bash', 'scripting', 'git', 'github', 'api', 'rest', 'integration', 'lean', 'linux', 'unix', 'remote', 'freelance', 'project']

### LLM Analysis Phase
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI
- **LLM Model:** gpt-5-mini
- **Fit Score:** 36/100
- **Acceptance Threshold:** 85/100
- **Final Decision:** ‚ùå REJECTED

#### Detailed Rationale
- Key requirements (from offer):
  - Idiomatic Golang (clean code, table-driven/unit/integration tests, refactoring)
  - AWS Serverless: Lambda, Step Functions, DynamoDB (single-table/composite keys), API Gateway
  - CDK in Go, Git-based workflows, CI/CD, infra testing
  - Developer tools / internal platform services experience
  - Observability (OpenTelemetry, AWS X-Ray), networking fundamentals, Bash/OAuth2 (nice-to-have)

- Match vs CV (concise):
  - Idiomatic Golang: NOT PRESENT ‚Äî CV shows no Go/Golang projects or libraries; primary languages are Java, Python, bash, Emacs Lisp, Jython.
  - AWS Serverless (Lambda / Step Functions / DynamoDB / API Gateway): PARTIAL ‚Äî very strong AWS certifications and broad AWS service knowledge; specific hands-on serverless projects (Lambda, Step Functions, DynamoDB single-table design) are not documented in project list (Lambda appears in general AWS services list but no concrete serverless implementations described).
  - CDK in Go: NOT PRESENT ‚Äî candidate lists Terraform and CloudFormation experience (HashiCorp Terraform Associate) but no CDK/Go usage.
  - Testing mindset & CI/CD: GOOD ‚Äî multiple projects cite GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, automated tests, infrastructure-as-code, live-scripting and a clear DevOps/testing focus.
  - Developer tools / internal platforms: GOOD ‚Äî has built tooling and frameworks (live-scripting, Project Bot, private AI deployments) and experience shaping solutions for internal use.
  - Observability / Networking / Bash / OAuth2: PARTIAL ‚Äî basic Prometheus/Grafana exposure, broad networking/AWS infra knowledge (VPC, ELB, Transit Gateway), Bash experience; no explicit OpenTelemetry or AWS X-Ray experience and OAuth2 is not documented (but SAML/SSO experience exists).
  - Soft / delivery fit: STRONG ‚Äî senior architecture, long track-record, cloud-architecture experience, remote-friendly, full-time contractor history.

- Overall rationale and recommendation:
  - Strengths: excellent senior AWS architecture, Terraform/Cloud native, DevOps and CI/CD experience; proven ability to design/operate complex production systems and build internal tooling.
  - Gaps vs role-critical needs: lack of demonstrated, idiomatic Go engineering and missing explicit serverless coding experience (Lambda + Step Functions + DynamoDB single-table patterns) and CDK-in-Go knowledge ‚Äî these are core to the client brief.
  - Conclusion: candidate is a strong cloud/architecture/DevOps fit and could ramp into serverless-Go work fairly quickly, but does not currently meet the "true Go/AWS Serverless expert" bar required for this role without upskilling or demonstrable Go serverless experience.

- Scoring note: weighted assessment penalizes absence of idiomatic Go and explicit serverless engineering experience while crediting strong AWS, DevOps, and platform/tooling expertise.
