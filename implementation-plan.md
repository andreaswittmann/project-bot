# Vue3 Frontend Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Implementing a Backend-for-Frontend pattern with Vue3 SPA and enhanced Flask REST API, replacing the current HTML dashboard while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Git Branch Strategy
- **Main Branch**: `main` (current stable version)
- **Feature Branch**: `feature/vue3-frontend` (new implementation)
- **Strategy**: Parallel development, switch over when feature parity achieved

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Process

### Testing Approach
Each implementation phase includes dedicated **manual User Acceptance Testing conducted by humans** to ensure quality and functionality before proceeding to the next phase. This iterative approach catches issues early and ensures the final product meets expectations.

**Important Note**: All UAT activities are performed manually by human testers, not by AI agents or automated systems. This ensures real-world usability validation and human judgment in evaluating the user experience.

### UAT Criteria for Each Phase

#### Phase 1 UAT Focus:
- **Environment Setup**: Verify development environment is properly configured
- **Git Workflow**: Ensure branching strategy works correctly
- **Foundation**: Confirm project structure follows best practices

#### Phase 2 UAT Focus:
- **API Functionality**: Test all new endpoints with real data
- **Error Handling**: Verify proper error responses and logging
- **Integration**: Ensure Flask enhancements work with existing system

#### Phase 3 UAT Focus:
- **Component Rendering**: Test all Vue3 components display correctly
- **State Management**: Verify Pinia stores manage data properly
- **Basic Interactions**: Test fundamental user interactions work

#### Phase 4 UAT Focus:
- **Feature Completeness**: Verify dashboard features match requirements
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensure statistics and filtering show correct results
- **User Experience**: Test intuitive navigation and interface

#### Phase 5 UAT Focus:
- **Workflow Integration**: Test all backend script integrations
- **End-to-End Operations**: Verify complete user workflows
- **File Operations**: Test project file management capabilities

#### Phase 6 UAT Focus:
- **Performance**: Verify app performs well under normal usage
- **Usability**: Test advanced features and user experience
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure functionality across devices/browsers

#### Phase 7 UAT Focus:
- **Quality Assurance**: Verify automated tests catch real issues
- **Documentation**: Ensure guides are complete and accurate
- **Stability**: Confirm system is ready for production use

#### Phase 8 UAT Focus:
- **Production Readiness**: Full system validation in production environment
- **Feature Parity**: Complete comparison with original dashboard
- **Go-Live Preparation**: Final validation before launch

### UAT Sign-off Process
- [ ] Each phase requires explicit UAT sign-off before proceeding
- [ ] Document all issues found and their resolution
- [ ] Maintain UAT checklist completion status
- [ ] Record any deviations from original requirements
- [ ] Update timeline if UAT reveals additional work needed
