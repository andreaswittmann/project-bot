## Workflow

1. **Scraping Phase:**
    - Bot fetches latest projects from RSS feeds
    - Parses project details and saves as markdown files with YAML frontmatter
    - Initializes project state as `scraped` with timestamp and metadata
    - Logs processed URLs to prevent duplicates

2. **Evaluation Phase:**
    - Pre-evaluation scores projects using keyword matching
    - Projects passing threshold get full LLM evaluation
    - State automatically updated to `accepted` or `rejected` with evaluation results
    - All projects remain in single `projects/` directory with state metadata

3. **Application Generation Phase:** *(Automatic for High-Fit Projects)*
    - Projects with fit score ‚â•90% automatically get professional German applications generated
    - Applications are appended to project markdown files
    - Project state updated to `applied` with generation metadata
    - Token usage and costs are tracked for all generations

4. **Application Submission Phase:**
    - Manually update project state to `sent` when application is submitted
    - Add notes about submission method and follow-up dates
    - State transitions to `open` when client responds

5. **Client Communication Phase:**
    - Track interview schedules, negotiations, and outcomes
    - Use `open` state for active client communications
    - Transition to `archived` when project is completed or lost

6. **Dashboard Management:**
     - Open `dashboard/dashboard.html` to review all processed projects
     - Filter by any combination of 8 states: scraped, evaluating, accepted, rejected, applied, sent, open, archived
     - Sort projects by state, scores, dates, or company
     - View complete state history and evaluation results
     - Track application costs and token usage across all states

7. **State Management:** *(Manual & Automatic)*
     - **Automatic**: State transitions during workflow processing
     - **Manual**: CLI commands for state overrides and corrections
     - **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all state changes with timestamps
     - **Query-able**: Filter and report on projects by state, company, or date range

8. **Purging Phase:** *(State-Based Cleanup)*
     - **Automatic**: Logs and temporary files are cleaned up during main workflow
     - **State-Based**: Different retention periods for each project state:
       - `archived`: 7 days (completed projects)
       - `rejected`: 1 day (aggressive cleanup)
       - `accepted`: 30 days (moderate retention)
       - `applied`: 90 days (long-term reference)
       - `sent`/`open`: 180-365 days (active projects)
     - **Smart Detection**: Uses state timestamps for accurate age calculation
     - **Manual Control**: Command-line options for targeted purging by state

## Advanced Features

### Automatic Application Generation
Configure intelligent application generation:

```yaml
application_generator:
  enabled: true
  auto_generation_threshold: 90  # Only generate for high-fit projects
  llm:
    provider: "Anthropic"        # Independent LLM for applications
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
```

**Benefits:**
- Only generates applications for projects with fit score ‚â•90%
- Uses professional German templates (tested and proven)
- Independent LLM configuration prevents cost conflicts
- Automatic cost tracking and token usage monitoring

### Custom Keyword Scoring
Fine-tune the pre-evaluation by adjusting keyword weights in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
weighted_tags:
  'aws': 30          # High value skills
  'python': 20       # Your expertise
  'remote': 15       # Work preferences
  'consulting': 15   # Project types
```

### Batch Processing
Process multiple projects efficiently:

```bash
# Process all pending projects
python evaluate_projects.py

# Generate applications for all accepted projects
python main.py --generate-applications --all-accepted

# See batch processing logs
ls projects_log/
```

### Dashboard Customization
The dashboard is a self-contained HTML file that can be:
- Customized with CSS modifications
- Extended with additional JavaScript features
- Deployed to any web server if needed
- Enhanced with application-specific visualizations

### Advanced State Management System
Complete project lifecycle tracking with flexible state transitions:

**Key Features:**
- **8-State Lifecycle**: Complete tracking from `scraped` ‚Üí `evaluating` ‚Üí `accepted`/`rejected` ‚Üí `applied` ‚Üí `sent` ‚Üí `open` ‚Üí `archived`
- **YAML Frontmatter**: Self-contained project files with complete metadata and state history
- **Manual Overrides**: Promote rejected projects to accepted, archive early if needed
- **Audit Trails**: Complete state transition history with timestamps and notes
- **CLI Management**: Command-line tools for state transitions and reporting
- **Query-able**: Filter projects by state, company, date range, or custom criteria

**State Management Examples:**
```bash
# View all projects by state
python main.py --state-list

# Manually promote a rejected project
python main.py --state-transition --project-file projects/project.md --new-state accepted --note "Manual review - good fit"

# Archive completed projects
python main.py --state-transition --project-file projects/project.md --new-state archived --note "Project completed successfully"

# Generate state distribution report
python main.py --state-report
```

### Intelligent File Purging System
State-based cleanup with configurable retention policies:

**Key Features:**
- **State-Based Cleanup**: Purge projects based on state age, not directory location
- **Granular Control**: Separate retention periods for each project state
- **Smart Age Detection**: Uses state timestamps for accurate age calculation
- **Safety First**: Dry-run mode, confirmation prompts, and comprehensive exclusion patterns
- **Automatic Integration**: Runs automatically during main workflow for logs and temp files
- **Manual Control**: Command-line options for targeted cleanup by project state

**Retention Examples:**
```bash
# Aggressive cleanup for archived projects (7 days)
python file_purger.py --categories archived

# Moderate retention for accepted projects (30 days)
python file_purger.py --categories accepted

# Long-term retention for open projects (365 days)
python file_purger.py --categories open
```

**Safety Features:**
- Preview mode to see what would be deleted without actually deleting
- Confirmation prompts (can be bypassed with `--force`)
- Comprehensive exclusion patterns to protect important files
- Maximum deletion limits per run to prevent accidents
